<td>04 October</td>
<td>[{{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} is now integrated with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/docs/services/Registry/iam.html#iam)</td>
<td>You can use IAM to control access to your registry resources, such as pulling, pushing, and building images. When you create a cluster, you also create a registry token so that the cluster can work with your registry. Therefore, you need the registry **Administrator** platform management role to create a cluster. To enable IAM for your registry account, see [Enabling policy enforcement for existing users](/docs/services/Registry/registry_users.html#existing_users).</td>

Now, {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} supports creating clusters in the `default` group or any other resource group that you create!</td>
