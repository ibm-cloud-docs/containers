Review frequently asked questions and key technologies that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses.


## What is {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} and how does it work?
{: #what-is-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is a managed offering to create your own Kubernetes cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. As a certified Kubernetes provider, {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management for your apps. Combined with an intuitive user experience, built-in security and isolation, and advanced tools to secure, manage, and monitor your cluster workloads, you can rapidly deliver highly available and secure containerized apps in the public cloud.

## What is Kubernetes?
{: #what-is-kube-overview}

Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services across multiple hosts, and offers management tools for deploying, automating, monitoring, and scaling containerized apps with minimal to no manual intervention.

The open source project, Kubernetes, combines running a containerized infrastructure with production workloads, open source contributions, and Docker container management tools. The Kubernetes infrastructure provides an isolated and secure app platform for managing containers that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of a failover. For more information, see [What is Kubernetes?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes){: external}.

Account
:   Your account refers to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

Cluster, worker pool, and worker node
:   A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master and one or more compute hosts that are called worker nodes. Worker nodes are organized into worker pools of the same flavor, or profile of CPU, memory, operating system, attached disks, and other properties. The worker nodes correspond to the Kubernetes `Node` resource, and are managed by a Kubernetes master that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. So when you deploy the resources for a containerized app, the Kubernetes master decides which worker node to deploy those resources on, accounting for the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster. Kubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods. For more information, see [Service architecture](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-arch).

Namespace
:   Kubernetes namespaces are a way to divide your cluster resources into separate areas that you can deploy apps and restrict access to, such as if you want to share the cluster with multiple teams. For example, system resources that are configured for you are kept in separate namespaces like `kube-system` or `ibm-system`. If you don't designate a namespace when you create a Kubernetes resource, the resource is automatically created in the `default` namespace. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/){: external}.

Service
:   A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/){: external}.

Deployment
:   A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You document a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster. The Kubernetes master configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the worker nodes with available capacity.

:   Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time. When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether the update is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.

:   A deployment is just one type of workload controller that you can use to manage pods. For help choosing among your options, see [What type of Kubernetes objects can I make for my app?](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy#object). For more information about deployments, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/){: external}.
  
Pod
:   Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. Usually, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/){: external}.

App
:   An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes. For more information, see [Planning app deployments](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy) and [Developing Kubernetes-native apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app).

## What are containers?
{: #what-are-containers-overview}

Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single unit that can run as a resource-isolated process on a compute server. To run your app in Kubernetes on {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, you must first containerize your app by creating a container image that you store in a container registry.

## What compute host infrastructure does the service offer?
{: #what-compute-infra-is-offered}

You can create clusters on Classic or {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} infrastructure. You can also bring your own hosts by using {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}.

For more information, see [Supported infrastructure providers](/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers).
