# Checking worker node resource reserves
{: #resource-limit-node}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} sets compute resource reserves that limit available compute resources on each worker node. Reserved memory, CPU resources, and process IDs (PIDs) can't be used by pods on the worker node, and reduces the allocatable resources on each worker node. When you initially deploy pods, if the worker node does not have enough allocatable resources, the deployment fails. Further, if pods exceed the worker node resource limit for memory and CPU, the pods are evicted. In Kubernetes, this limit is called a [hard eviction threshold](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/#hard-eviction-thresholds){: external}. For pods that exceed the PID limit, the pods receive as many PIDs as allocatable, but are not evicted based on PIDs.
{: shortdesc}

If less PIDs, CPU or memory is available than the worker node reserves, Kubernetes starts to evict pods to restore sufficient compute resources and PIDs. The pods reschedule onto another worker node if a worker node is available. If your pods are evicted frequently, add more worker nodes to your cluster or set [resource limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container){: external} on your pods.

The resources that are reserved on your worker node depend on the amount of PIDs, CPU and memory that your worker node comes with. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} defines PIDs, CPU and memory tiers as shown in the following tables. If your worker node comes with compute resources in multiple tiers, a percentage of your PIDs, CPU and memory resources is reserved for each tier.

Clusters also have process ID (PID) reservations and limits, to prevent a pod from using too many PIDs or ensure that enough PIDs exist for the `kubelet` and other {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} system components. If the PID reservations or limits are reached, Kubernetes does not create or assign new PIDs until enough processes are removed to free up existing PIDs. The total amount of PIDs on a worker node approximately corresponds to 8,000 PIDs per GB of memory on the worker node. For example, a worker node with 16 GB of memory has approximately 128,000 PIDs (`16 × 8,000 = 128,000`).

To review how much compute resources are currently used on your worker node, run [`kubectl top node`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#top){: external}.
