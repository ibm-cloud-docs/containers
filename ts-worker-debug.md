Review the options to debug your worker nodes and find the root causes for failures.

## Check worker node notifications and maintenance updates
{: #worker-debug-notifs}

Check the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} health and status dashboard for any notifications or maintenance updates that might be relevant to your worker nodes. These notifications or updates might help determine the cause of the worker node failures.

1. [Classic clusters]{: tag-classic-inf} Check the [health dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/health-dashboard){: external} for any {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} emergency maintenance notifications that might affect classic worker nodes in your account. Depending on the nature of the maintenance notification, you might need to reboot or reload your worker nodes. 
1. Check the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [status dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external} for any known problems that might affect your worker nodes or cluster. If any of the following components show an error status, that component might be the cause of your worker node disruptions. 
    - For all clusters, check the **Kubernetes Service** and **Container Registry** components.
    - For VPC clusters, check the **Virtual Private Cloud**, **Virtual Private Endpoint** and **Virtual Server for VPC** components.
    - For Classic clusters, check the **Classic Infrastructure Provisioning** and **Virtual Servers** components.


## Quick steps to resolve worker node issues
{: #worker-debug-quick}

If your worker node is not functioning as expected, you can follow these steps to update your cluster and command line tools or run diagnostic tests. If the issue persists, see [Debugging your worker node](#worker-debug-steps) for additional steps. 
{: shortdesc}

1. [Update your cluster and worker nodes to the latest version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#update).
2. [Update your command line tools](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-update).


## Debugging your worker node
{: #worker-debug-steps}

### Step 1: Get the worker node state
{: #worker-debug-get-state}

If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, review the state of your worker nodes.

```sh
ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
```
{: pre}

### Step 2: Review the worker node state
{: #worker-debug-rev-state}

Review the **State** and **Status** field for every worker node in your CLI output.

For more information, see [Worker node states](/docs/containers?topic=containers-worker-node-state-reference).

### Step 3: Get the details for each worker node
{: #worker-debug-get-details}

Get the details for the worker node. If the details include an error message, review the list of [common error messages for worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-common_worker_nodes_issues) to learn how to resolve the problem.

```sh
ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --worker <worker_node_id>
```
{: pre}

### Step 4: Review the infrastructure provider for the worker node
{: #worker-debug-rev-infra}

Review the infrastructure environment to check for other reasons that might cause the worker node issues.
1. Check with your networking team to make sure that no recent maintenance, such as firewall or subnet updates, might impact the worker node connections.
2. Review [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/status/){: external} for **{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}** and the underlying infrastructure provider, such as **Virtual Servers** for classic, **VPC** related components, or **{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}**.
3. If you have access to the underlying infrastructure, such as classic **Virtual Servers**, review the details of the corresponding machines for the worker nodes.
