# Why does binding a service to a cluster results in service does not support service keys error?
{: #ts-app-svc-key}
{: support}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}


When you run `ibmcloud ks cluster service bind --cluster <cluster_name> --namespace <namespace> --service <service_instance_name>`, you see the following message.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
This service doesn't support creation of keys
```
{: screen}



Some services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, such as {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}} don't support the creation of service credentials, also referred to as service keys. Without the support of service keys, the service can't be bound to a cluster. To find a list of services that support service keys, see [Enabling external apps to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services](/docs/account?topic=account-externalapp#externalapp).
{: tsCauses}



To integrate services that don't support service keys, check if the service provides an API that you can use to access the service directly from your app. For example, if you want to use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}}, see the [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/key-protect){: external}.
