### Update before master
{: #before_127}

The following table shows the actions that you must take before you update the Kubernetes master.



| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Unsupported:** Beta version of the `CSIStorageCapacity` API | Migrate manifests and API clients to use the `storage.k8s.io/v1` API version, available since Kubernetes version 1.24. For more information, see [Deprecated API Migration Guide - v1.27](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-27){: external}. | 
| **Unsupported:** Pod `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io` annotations | Kubernetes no longer supports the pod `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io` annotations. These annotations have been deprecated since Kubernetes version 1.19 and has been replaced by the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field for pods and containers. If your pods rely on these unsupported annotations, update them to use the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field instead. For more information, see [Create Pod that uses the container runtime default `seccomp` profile](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/#create-pod-that-uses-the-container-runtime-default-seccomp-profile){: external}. |
| `k8s.gcr.io` redirect to `registry.k8s.io` | Kubernetes version 1.27 release artifacts are not published to the `k8s.gcr.io` registry. Furthermore, `k8s.gcr.io` registry traffic are redirected to `registry.k8s.io`. For more information, see [k8s.gcr.io Redirect to registry.k8s.io - What You Need to Know](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/){: external}. Note that IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service has already handled this migration action for all resources provided by IBM. |
| `kubelet` legacy iptables rules | `kubelet` no longer creates certain legacy iptables rules by default. It is possible that this will cause problems with some third-party components that improperly depended on those rules. For more information, see [Kubernetes’s IPTables Chains Are Not API](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/07/iptables-chains-not-api/){: external}. |
