# Planning your cluster network setup   
{: #plan_clusters}

Design a network setup for your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} cluster that meets the needs of your workloads and environment.
{: shortdesc}

Get started by planning your setup for a VPC or a classic cluster.
- With [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters in VPC](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basics), you can create your cluster in the next generation of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform, in [Virtual Private Cloud](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpc) for Generation 2 compute resources. VPC gives you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud.
- With [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} classic clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_basics), you can create your cluster on classic infrastructure. Classic clusters include all the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} mature and robust features for compute, networking, and storage.



Review the following cluster configurations and take the appropriate action in your account before provisioning your clusters. For more information, see [Preparing to create clusters at the account level](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters&interface=ui).

- For VPC Clusters that don't require Classic Infrastructure Access, no account changes are required.

- For VPC Clusters that require Classic Infrastructure Access, you must [enable VRF](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf) & [service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#service-endpoint) in your account.

- For Classic clusters with a private service endpoint enabled, you must [enable VRF](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf) & [service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#service-endpoint).
