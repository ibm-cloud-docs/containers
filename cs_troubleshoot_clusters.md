# Worker nodes
{: #cs_troubleshoot_clusters}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, consider these techniques for general troubleshooting and debugging your cluster and cluster master.
{: shortdesc}

**General ways to resolve issues**<br>
1. Keep your cluster environment up to date.
   * Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).
   * [Update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master) to the latest default version for [{{site.data.keyword.containershort}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
2. Make sure that your command line tools are up to date.
   * In the terminal, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up-to-date so that you can use all available commands and flags.
   * Make sure that [your `kubectl` CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).
<br>

**Reviewing issues and status**<br>
1. To see whether {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is available, [check the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status){: external}.
2. Filter for the **Kubernetes Service** component.

## Debugging worker nodes
{: #debug_worker_nodes}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

Review the options to debug your worker nodes and find the root causes for failures.

1. If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, review the state of your worker nodes.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
    ```
    {: pre}
2. Review the **State** and **Status** field for every worker node in your CLI output.
    You can view the current worker node state by running the `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID` command and locating the **State** and **Status** fields.
{: shortdesc}
    <table summary="Every table row should be read left to right, with the cluster state in column one and a description in column two.">

    <tr>
        <td>`Critical`</td>
        <td>A worker node can go into a Critical state for many reasons: <ul><li>You initiated a reboot for your worker node without cordoning and draining your worker node. Rebooting a worker node can cause data corruption in <code>containerd</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, <code>kube-proxy</code>, and <code>calico</code>. </li>
        <li>The pods that are deployed to your worker node do not use resource limits for [memory ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/) and [CPU ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/). Without resource limits, pods can consume all available resources, leaving no resources for other pods to run on this worker node. This overcommitment of workload causes the worker node to fail. </li>
        <li><code>containerd</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, or <code>calico</code> went into an unrecoverable state after it ran hundreds or thousands of containers over time. </li>
        <li>You set up a Virtual Router Appliance for your worker node that went down and cut off the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master. </li><li> Current networking issues in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or IBM Cloud infrastructure that causes the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master to fail.</li>
        <li>Your worker node ran out of capacity. Check the <strong>Status</strong> of the worker node to see whether it shows <strong>Out of disk</strong> or <strong>Out of memory</strong>. If your worker node is out of capacity, consider to either reduce the workload on your worker node or add a worker node to your cluster to help load balance the workload.</li>
        <li>The device was powered off from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console resource list ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources). Open the resource list and find your worker node ID in the **Devices** list. In the action menu, click **Power On**.</li></ul>
        In many cases, [reloading](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) your worker node can solve the problem. When you reload your worker node, the latest [patch version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#version_types) is applied to your worker node. The major and minor version is not changed. Before you reload your worker node, make sure to cordon and drain your worker node to ensure that the existing pods are terminated gracefully and rescheduled onto remaining worker nodes. </br></br> If reloading the worker node does not resolve the issue, go to the next step to continue troubleshooting your worker node.<p class="tip">In classic clusters, you can [configure health checks for your worker node and enable Autorecovery](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#autorecovery). If Autorecovery detects an unhealthy worker node based on the configured checks, Autorecovery triggers a corrective action like an OS reload on the worker node. For more information about how Autorecovery works, see the [Autorecovery blog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/autorecovery-utilizes-consistent-hashing-high-availability).</p>

You try to manage worker nodes for a new or an existing cluster by running one of the following commands.
* Provision workers: `ibmcloud ks cluster create classic`, `ibmcloud ks worker-pool rebalance`, or `ibmcloud ks worker-pool resize`
* Reload workers: `ibmcloud ks worker reload` or `ibmcloud ks worker update`
* Reboot workers: `ibmcloud ks worker reboot`

{: tsCauses}
The infrastructure credentials that are set for the region and resource group are missing the appropriate [infrastructure permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference#infra). The user's infrastructure permissions are most commonly stored as an [API key](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#api_key) for the region and resource group. More rarely, if you use a [different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account type](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#understand_infra), you might have [set infrastructure credentials manually](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#credentials). If you use a different classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account to provision infrastructure resources, you might also have [orphaned clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#orphaned) in your account.

{: tsResolve}
The account owner must set up the infrastructure account credentials properly. The credentials depend on what type of infrastructure account you are using.

Before you begin, [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure).

1.  Identify what user credentials are used for the region and resource group's infrastructure permissions.
    1.  Check the API key for a region and resource group of the cluster.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks api-key info --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        Getting information about the API key owner for cluster <cluster_name>...
        OK
        Name                Email
        <user_name>         <name@email.com>
        ```
        {: screen}
    2.  Check if the classic infrastructure account for the region and resource group is manually set to use a different IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks credential get --region <us-south>
        ```
        {: pre}

        **Example output if credentials are set to use a different classic account**. In this case, the user's infrastructure credentials are used for the region and resource group that you targeted, even if a different user's credentials are stored in the API key that you retrieved in the previous step.
        ```
        OK
        Infrastructure credentials for user name <1234567_name@email.com> set for resource group <resource_group_name>.
        ```
        {: screen}

        **Example output if credentials are not set to use a different classic account**. In this case, the API key owner that you retrieved in the previous step has the infrastructure credentials that are used for the region and resource group.
        ```
        FAILED
        No credentials set for resource group <resource_group_name>.: The user credentials could not be found. (E0051)
        ```
        {: screen}
2.  Validate the infrastructure permissions that the user has.
    1.  List the suggested and required infrastructure permissions for the region and resource group.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks infra-permissions get --region <region>
        ```
        {: pre}

        For console and CLI commands to assign these permissions, see [Classic infrastructure roles](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference#infra).
        {: tip}

    2.  Make sure that the [infrastructure credentials owner for the API key or the manually-set account has the correct permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#owner_permissions).
    3.  If necessary, you can change the [API key](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_api_key_reset) or [manually-set](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_set) infrastructure credentials owner for the region and resource group.
3.  Test that the changed permissions permit authorized users to perform infrastructure operations for the cluster.
    1.  For example, you might try to a delete a worker node.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker rm --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  Check to see if the worker node is removed.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output if the worker node removal is successful. The `worker get` operation fails because the worker node is deleted. The infrastructure permissions are correctly set up.
        ```
        FAILED
        The specified worker node could not be found. (E0011)
        ```
        {: screen}

    3.  If the worker node is not removed, review that [**State** and **Status** fields](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#debug_worker_nodes) and the [common issues with worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#common_worker_nodes_issues) to continue debugging.
    4.  If you manually set credentials and still cannot see the cluster's worker nodes in your infrastructure account, you might check whether the [cluster is orphaned](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#orphaned).

TOTP MFA also affects the access that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} requires to make calls to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure. If TOTP is enabled for the account, you cannot create and manage clusters and worker nodes in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.

{: tsResolve}
Classic clusters only: The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account owner or an account administrator must either:
* Disable TOTP for the account, and continue to use the automatically linked infrastructure credentials for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.
* Continue to use TOTP, but create an infrastructure API key that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} can use to make direct calls to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure API.
**Note**: You cannot use TOTP if you want to use VPC clusters, because {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} does not support manually setting infrastructure credentials for VPC clusters.

**To disable TOTP MFA for the account:**
1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}. From the menu bar, select **Manage > Access (IAM)**.
2. In the left navigation, click the **Settings** page.
3. Under **Multifactor authentication**, click **Edit**.
4. Select **None**, and click **Update**.

**To use TOTP MFA and create an infrastructure API key for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}:**
1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} console, select **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Users** and click the name of the account owner. **Note**: If you do not use the account owner's credentials, first [ensure that the user whose credentials you use has the correct permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#owner_permissions).
2. In the **API Keys** section, find or create a classic infrastructure API key.
3. Use the infrastructure API key to set the infrastructure API credentials for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. Repeat this command for each region where you create clusters.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks credential set classic --infrastructure-username <infrastructure_API_username> --infrastructure-api-key <infrastructure_API_authentication_key> --region <region>
    ```
    {: pre}
4. Verify that the correct credentials are set.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks credential get --region <region>
    ```
    Example output:
    ```
    Infrastructure credentials for user name user@email.com set for resource group default.
    ```
    {: screen}
5. To ensure that existing clusters use the updated infrastructure API credentials, run `ibmcloud ks api-key reset --region <region>` in each region where you have clusters.

## Cannot add worker nodes due to an invalid VLAN ID
{: #suspended}

{: tsSymptoms}
Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account was suspended, or all worker nodes in your cluster were deleted. After the account is reactivated, you cannot add worker nodes when you try to resize or rebalance your worker pool. You see an error message similar to the following:

```
SoftLayerAPIError(SoftLayer_Exception_Public): Could not obtain network VLAN with id #123456.
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
When an account is suspended, the worker nodes within the account are deleted. If a cluster has no worker nodes, IBM Cloud infrastructure reclaims the associated public and private VLANs. However, the cluster worker pool still has the previous VLAN IDs in its metadata and uses these unavailable IDs when you rebalance or resize the pool. The nodes fail to create because the VLANs are no longer associated with the cluster.

{: tsResolve}

You can [delete your existing worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_rm), then [create a new worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_create).

Alternatively, you can keep your existing worker pool by ordering new VLANs and using these to create new worker nodes in the pool.

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1.  To get the zones that you need new VLAN IDs for, note the **Location** in the following command output. **Note**: If your cluster is a multizone, you need VLAN IDs for each zone.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster ls
    ```
    {: pre}

2.  Get a new private and public VLAN for each zone that your cluster is in by [contacting {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support](/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-ordering-premium-vlans#ordering-premium-vlans).

3.  Note the new private and public VLAN IDs for each zone.

4.  Note the name of your worker pools.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  Use the `zone network-set` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_zone_network_set) to change the worker pool network metadata.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks zone network-set --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> -- worker-pool ls <worker-pool> --private-vlan <private_vlan_ID> --public-vlan <public_vlan_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

6.  **Multizone cluster only**: Repeat **Step 5** for each zone in your cluster.

7.  Rebalance or resize your worker pool to add worker nodes that use the new VLAN IDs. For example:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker-pool resize --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone>
    ```
    {: pre}

8.  Verify that your worker nodes are created.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool>
    ```
    {: pre}

<br />


## Unable to modify or delete infrastructure in an orphaned cluster
{: #orphaned}

{: tsSymptoms}
You cannot perform infrastructure-related commands on your cluster, such as:
* Adding or removing worker nodes
* Reloading or rebooting worker nodes
* Resizing worker pools
* Updating your cluster

You cannot view the cluster worker nodes in your classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account. However, you can update and manage other clusters in the account.

Further, you verified that you have the [proper infrastructure credentials](#cs_credentials).

{: tsCauses}
The cluster might be provisioned in a classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account that is no longer linked to your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} account. The cluster is orphaned. Because the resources are in a different account, you do not have the infrastructure credentials to modify the resources.

Consider the following scenario to understand how clusters might become orphaned.
1.  You have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go account.
2.  You create a cluster named `Cluster1`. The worker nodes and other infrastructure resources are provisioned into the infrastructure account that comes with your Pay-As-You-Go account.
3.  Later, you find out that your team uses a legacy or shared classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account. You use the `ibmcloud ks credential set` command to change the IBM Cloud infrastructure credentials to use your team account.
4.  You create another cluster named `Cluster2`. The worker nodes and other infrastructure resources are provisioned into the team infrastructure account.
5.  You notice that `Cluster1` needs a worker node update, a worker node reload, or you just want to clean it up by deleting it. However, because `Cluster1` was provisioned into a different infrastructure account, you cannot modify its infrastructure resources. `Cluster1` is orphaned.
6.  You follow the resolution steps in the following section, but do not set your infrastructure credentials back to your team account. You can delete `Cluster1`, but now `Cluster2` is orphaned.
7.  You change your infrastructure credentials back to the team account that created `Cluster2`. Now, you no longer have an orphaned cluster!

<br>

{: tsResolve}
1.  Check which infrastructure account the region that your cluster is in currently uses to provision clusters.
    1.  Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external}.
    2.  From the table, select your cluster.
    3.  In the **Overview** tab, check for an **Infrastructure User** field. This field helps you determine if your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} account uses a different infrastructure account than the default.
        * If you do not see the **Infrastructure User** field, you have a linked Pay-As-You-Go account that uses the same credentials for your infrastructure and platform accounts. The cluster that cannot be modified might be provisioned in a different infrastructure account.
        * If you see an **Infrastructure User** field, you use a different infrastructure account than the one that came with your Pay-As-You-Go account. These different credentials apply to all clusters within the region. The cluster that cannot be modified might be provisioned in your Pay-As-You-Go or a different infrastructure account.
2.  Check which infrastructure account was used to provision the cluster.
    1.  In the **Worker Nodes** tab, select a worker node and note its **ID**.
    2.  Open the menu ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu icon") and click **Classic Infrastructure**.
    3.  From the infrastructure navigation pane, click **Devices > Device List**.
    4.  Search for the worker node ID that you previously noted.
    5.  If you do not find the worker node ID, the worker node is not provisioned into this infrastructure account. Switch to a different infrastructure account and try again.
3.  Use the `ibmcloud ks credential set` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_set) to change your infrastructure credentials to the account that the cluster worker nodes are provisioned in, which you found in the previous step.
    If you no longer have access to and cannot get the infrastructure credentials, you must open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case to remove the orphaned cluster.
    {: note}
4.  [Delete the cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-remove).
5.  If you want, reset the infrastructure credentials to the previous account. Note that if you created clusters with a different infrastructure account than the account that you switch to, you might orphan those clusters.
    * To set credentials to a different infrastructure account, use the `ibmcloud ks credential set` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_set).
    * To use the default credentials that come with your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go account, use the `ibmcloud ks credential unset --region <region>` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_unset).

## Accessing your worker node with SSH fails
{: #cs_ssh_worker}

{: tsSymptoms}
You cannot access your worker node by using an SSH connection.

{: tsCauses}
SSH by password is unavailable on the worker nodes.

{: tsResolve}
Use a Kubernetes [`DaemonSet`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/){: external} for actions that you must run on every node, or use jobs for one-time actions that you must run.

<br />


## Bare metal instance ID is inconsistent with worker records
{: #bm_machine_id}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you use `ibmcloud ks worker` commands with your bare metal worker node, you see a message similar to the following.

```
The worker node instance ID changed. Reload the worker node if bare metal hardware was serviced.
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
The machine ID can become inconsistent with the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} worker record when the machine experiences hardware issues. When IBM Cloud infrastructure resolves this issue, a component can change within the system that the service does not identify.

{: tsResolve}
For {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} to re-identify the machine, [reload the bare metal worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload). **Note**: Reloading also updates the machine's [patch version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog).

You can also [delete the bare metal worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_rm). **Note**: Bare metal instances are billed monthly.

<br />


## After a worker node updates or reloads, duplicate nodes and pods appear
{: #cs_duplicate_nodes}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you run `kubectl get nodes`, you see duplicate worker nodes with the status **`NotReady`**. The worker nodes with **`NotReady`** have public IP addresses, while the worker nodes with **`Ready`** have private IP addresses.

{: tsCauses}
Older clusters listed worker nodes by the cluster's public IP address. Now, worker nodes are listed by the cluster's private IP address. When you reload or update a node, the IP address is changed, but the reference to the public IP address remains.

{: tsResolve}
Service is not disrupted due to these duplicates, but you can remove the old worker node references from the API server.

  ```
  kubectl delete node <node_name1> <node_name2>
  ```
  {: pre}

<br />


## Accessing a pod on a new worker node fails with a timeout
{: #cs_nodes_duplicate_ip}

{: tsSymptoms}
You deleted a worker node in your cluster and then added a worker node. When you deployed a pod or Kubernetes service, the resource cannot access the newly created worker node, and the connection times out.

{: tsCauses}
If you delete a worker node from your cluster and then add a worker node, the new worker node might be assigned the private IP address of the deleted worker node. Calico uses this private IP address as a tag and continues to try to reach the deleted node.

{: tsResolve}
Manually update the reference of the private IP address to point to the correct node.

1.  Confirm that you have two worker nodes with the same **Private IP** address. Note the **Private IP** and **ID** of the deleted worker.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```
  ID                                                 Public IP       Private IP       Machine Type   State     Status   Zone   Version
  kube-dal10-cr9b7371a7fcbe46d08e04f046d5e6d8b4-w1   169.xx.xxx.xxx  10.xxx.xx.xxx    b3c.4x16       normal    Ready    dal10      1.16.8
  kube-dal10-cr9b7371a7fcbe46d08e04f046d5e6d8b4-w2   169.xx.xxx.xxx  10.xxx.xx.xxx    b3c.4x16       deleted    -       dal10      1.16.8
  ```
  {: screen}

2.  Install the [Calico CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies#adding_network_policies).
3.  List the available worker nodes in Calico. Replace <path_to_file> with the local path to the Calico configuration file.

  ```
  calicoctl get nodes --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```
  NAME
  kube-dal10-cr9b7371a7faaa46d08e04f046d5e6d8b4-w1
  kube-dal10-cr9b7371a7faaa46d08e04f046d5e6d8b4-w2
  ```
  {: screen}

4.  Delete the duplicate worker node in Calico. Replace NODE_ID with the worker node ID.

  ```
  calicoctl delete node NODE_ID --config=<path_to_file>/calicoctl.cfg
  ```
  {: pre}

5.  Reboot the worker node that was not deleted.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks worker reboot --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --worker <worker_id>
  ```
  {: pre}


The deleted node is no longer listed in Calico.
