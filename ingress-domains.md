# Setting up a domain for your cluster
{: #ingress-domains}

When you create a cluster, an Ingress subdomain is registered by default for your cluster in the format `<cluster_name>.<globally_unique_account_HASH>-0000.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`. Additionally, you can make your apps reachable at a custom domain by creating your own domain registered with IBM Cloud's internal domain provider, or a domain registered with an external provider. You can also add an existing domain to your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

This functionality is available in beta and is subject to change.
{: beta}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides a managed, internal provider that you can use to create your own domains. With the managed domain provider, you do not need to create and maintain an account with an external provider. You can also utilize health check monitoring for your managed domains. When creating a domain with the internal provider, you specify a subdomain name, such as `exampledomain`, and the new domain is named in the format `exampledomain.<zone>.containers.appdomain.cloud`. 

You can also use your own external DNS provider. You must have an account with the external provider that you want to use. The following external providers are supported:
- [Akamai]{: tag-blue}
- [Cloudflare]{: tag-red}
- [CIS]{: tag-cool-gray}



## Accessing domains in the console
{: #ingress-domains-ui-access}
{: ui}

Navigate to the your cluster's **Domains** page to create and manage domains. 

1. In the console, navigate to your [clusters tab](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external}. 
2. Click on the cluster where you want to create or change a domain.
3. Click **Ingress**. 
4. Click the **Domains** tab. From here, you can manage the domains associated with the cluster. 

## Creating domains in the console
{: #ingress-domains-ui}
{: ui}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to create your own domain in your cluster, or add a domain that already exists in your provider account. Follow the console instructions to make the following domain configurations.

If you are using the **{{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}}** provider, you must first [set up service-to-service authorization](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth&interface=ui#create-auth) for your {{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}} instance. Set the source service as `Kubernetes Service`, and the target as `Internet services`. Assign the `Manager` role. 
{: note}

### Domain details
{: #ingress-domains-ui-details}
{: ui}

- **Domain name**: The name of the domain to create or add to your cluster. This can be a domain that exists in your provider account, or a new domain. 
- **Provider**: Choose a provider for your domain. To create a managed domain with IBM Cloud's internal provider, choose **Managed**. To use an external provider, choose from the remaining provider types. To use an external provider, such as Cloudflare, you must have an account with that provider and you must enter your provider credentials. IBM Cloud uses these credentials to register domains and update records in your DNS provider.
- **Set as default**: Choose whether you want to set the domain as the default for the cluster. The default Ingress domain is used to form a unique URL for each of your apps and is the domain that is referenced by the IP addresses of any public ALBs in your cluster. You can change which domain is set as the default at any time. Setting a default domain replaces the current default. 

### Registration details
{: #ingress-domains-ui-registration}
{: ui}

- Add one or more **IP addresses** (for Classic or VPC clusters) or **Hostnames** (for VPC clusters) to register to the domain. You can update which IP addresses or hostnames are registered.
- **Secret namespace**: Specify the namespace that the TLS secret for the domain is created in. If you don't specify a namespace, the secret is created in the `default` namespace.

### Credentials
{: #ingress-domains-ui-credentials}
{: ui}

Your DNS credentials are required to create or add a domain with external providers, such as Cloudflare or Akamai. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses these credentials to provision or access a domain from the external provider on your behalf. You must use the same set of credentials for each domain in a cluster.

Different providers might require different credentials, such as access tokens or secrets. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} does not provide the credentials; you must acquire them from the external provider. 

#### Required credentials for Akamai
{: #ingress-domains-ui-credentials-akamai}

Follow the steps to find the required Akamai credentials. 

1. Gather the required access token, client token, client secret, and host from Akamai by following the steps to [create authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials){: external} in the Akamai documentation.

2. In your Akamai account dashboard, find the DNS zone to add to your provider credentials. Note the full zone name, such as `example.external.adppdomain.cloud`.

#### Required credentials for Cloudflare
{: #ingress-domains-ui-credentials-cloudflare}

Follow the steps to find the required Cloudflare credentials. 

1. Find the Cloudflare API access token to add to your provider credentials. For more information, see [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/){: external} in the Cloudflare documentation. 

2. In your Cloudflare account, find the DNS zone to add to your provider credentials. For steps to find the DNS zone, see [Find zone and account IDs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/){: external} in the Cloudflare documentation. 

## Managing your domain in the console
{: #ingress-domains-ui-manage}
{: ui}

You can complete the following actions to manage your domain. 

Delete a domain
:   If you delete a domain from a cluster, the domain cannot be recovered. If you later need the domain, you must reprovision it. If delete a domain that is registered with the managed provider, you cannot reuse that domain name. Note that you cannot delete a cluster's default domain. If you want to delete the domain that is currently registered as the default, you must first assign a different default domain.

Update a domain's IP addresses or hostname
:   When you update the IP addresses or hostnames, you must include any IPs or hostnames that are currently registered to the domain. The domain updates with the exact values specified, so any current IP addresses or hostnames are overwritten if they are not included. For example, if `52.137.182.166` is currently registered to your domain and you want to add `52.137.182.270`, you must specify both IP addresses.

Change a cluster's default domain
:   You can change the default domain to any domain that exists in your cluster. This change might take up to five minutes to apply. During that time, your domain might experience downtime. 


## Setting up domains with the managed {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} internal provider
{: #ingress-domain-int}
{: cli}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides a managed, internal provider that you can use to create your own domains. You can use the `ibmcloud ks ingress domain create` command to create a new domain, or you can specify an existing domain that you want to add to your cluster. When you create a domain with the internal provider, you may specify a subdomain name, such as `exampledomain`, or provide the fully qualified domain name. The new domain is named in the format `exampledomain.<zone>.containers.appdomain.cloud`. 

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} internal managed domain provider is Akamai. You can also use your own Akamai account to create or add domains. When you get the details of a domain, you may see the provider type listed as `akamai` or `akamai-ext`. The `akamai` provider type refers to the internal {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} domain provider, and `akamai-ext` refers to your own external Akamai account that you directly register the domain with. If you provide the fully qualified domain name, the zone of your domain must match the zone your cluster was created in.

### Listing all domains in a cluster
{: #ingress-domains-manage-view-ls}

For more details and command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=ui#ingress-domain-ls).

```sh
ibmcloud ks ingress domain ls --cluster CLUSTER
```
{: pre}

### Getting the details of a single domain
{: #ingress-domains-manage-view-get}

For more details and command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=ui#ingress-domain-get).

```sh
ibmcloud ks ingress domain credential get --cluster CLUSTER 
```
{: pre}

### Removing a domain from a cluster
{: #ingress-domains-manage-rm}

If you delete a domain from a cluster, the domain cannot be recovered. If you later need the domain, you must reprovision it. Note that you cannot delete a cluster's default domain. If you want to delete the domain that is currently registered as the default, you must first [assign a different default domain](#ingress-domain-manage-default).

If you delete a domain that is registered with the IBM internal provider, you cannot reuse the domain name.
{: note}

For more details and command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=ui#ingress-domain-rm).

```sh
ibmcloud ks ingress domain rm --cluster CLUSTER --domain DOMAIN
```
{: pre}

### Updating a domain's IP addresses or hostname
{: #ingress-domains-manage-update}

You can update a domain's registered IP addresses (for Classic or VPC clusters) or hostname (for VPC clusters) after the domain is created or added to the cluster. This command updates all the resources in your cluster with the specified IP addresses or hostnames and changes your app URLs. 

For more information and command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=ui#ingress-domain-update).

Note that when you add IP addresses or hostnames, you must include any IPs or hostnames that are currently registered to the domain. The domain updates with the exact values specified, so any current IP addresses or hostnames are overwritten if they are not included. For example, if `52.137.182.166` is currently registered to your domain and you want to add `52.137.182.270`, you must specify `--ip 52.137.182.166 --ip 52.137.182.270` in the command.
{: important}

```sh
ibmcloud ks ingress domain update --cluster CLUSTER --domain DOMAIN [--hostname HOSTNAME] [--ip IP] 
```
{: pre}

### Changing a cluster's default domain
{: #ingress-domain-manage-default}

The default Ingress domain is used to form a unique URL for each of your apps and is the domain that is referenced by the IP addresses of any public ALBs in your cluster. When you provision a cluster, the default Ingress domain is automatically created for you, but you can change the default domain to any domain that exists in your cluster. To check your cluster's default domain, run `ibmcloud ks cluster get` and find the **Ingress subdomain** in the output. 

For more details and command options, see the [CLI reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=ui#ingress-domain-default-replace).

It can take up to five minutes for the default domain to update. During that time, your domain might experience downtime.
