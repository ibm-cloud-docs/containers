# Monitoring cluster health
{: #health-monitor}

Set up monitoring in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to help you troubleshoot issues and improve the health and performance of your Kubernetes clusters and apps.
{: shortdesc}

Continuous monitoring and logging is the key to detecting attacks on your cluster and troubleshooting issues as they arise. By continuously monitoring your cluster, you're able to better understand your cluster capacity and the availability of resources that are available to your app. With this insight, you can prepare to protect your apps against downtime.

## Choosing a monitoring solution
{: #view_metrics}

Metrics help you monitor the health and performance of your clusters. You can use the standard Kubernetes and container runtime features to monitor the health of your clusters and apps.
{: shortdesc}

Every Kubernetes master is continuously monitored by IBM. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} automatically scans every node where the Kubernetes master is deployed for vulnerabilities that are found in Kubernetes and OS-specific security fixes. If vulnerabilities are found, {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} automatically applies fixes and resolves vulnerabilities on behalf of the user to ensure master node protection. You are responsible for monitoring and analyzing the logs for the rest of your cluster components.

To avoid conflicts when using metrics services, be sure that clusters across resource groups and regions have unique names.
{: tip}

<dl>
  <dt>{{site.data.keyword.mon_full}}</dt>
  <dd>Gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your apps and your cluster by deploying a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent to your worker nodes. The agent collects pod and cluster metrics, and sends these metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. For more information about {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}, see the [service documentation](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-getting-started). To set up the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent in your cluster, see [Viewing cluster and app metrics with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](#sysdig).</dd>

  <dt>Kubernetes dashboard</dt>
  <dd>The Kubernetes dashboard is an administrative web interface where you can review the health of your worker nodes, find Kubernetes resources, deploy containerized apps, and troubleshoot apps with logging and monitoring information. For more information about how to access your Kubernetes dashboard, see [Launching the Kubernetes dashboard for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_app#cli_dashboard).</dd>

</dl>

<br />

## Forwarding cluster and app metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}
{: #sysdig}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability plug-in to create a monitoring configuration for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} in your cluster, and use this monitoring configuration to automatically collect and forward metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

With {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}, you can collects cluster and pod metrics, such as the CPU and memory usage of your worker nodes, incoming and outgoing HTTP traffic for your pods, and data about several infrastructure components. In addition, the agent can collect custom application metrics by using either a Prometheus-compatible scraper or a StatsD facade.

Considerations for using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability plug-in:
* You can have only one monitoring configuration for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} in your cluster at a time. If you want to use a different {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service instance to send metrics to, use the [`ibmcloud ob monitoring config replace`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-observability_cli#monitoring_config_replace) command.<ff-satellite>
* {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} clusters in {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} cannot currently use the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} console or the observability plug-in CLI to enable monitoring for {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} clusters. You must manually deploy monitoring agents to your cluster to forward metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}}.</ff-satellite>
* If you created a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} configuration in your cluster without using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability plug-in, you can use the [`ibmcloud ob monitoring agent discover`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-observability_cli#monitoring_agent_discover) command to make the configuration visible to the plug-in. Then, you can use the observability plug-in commands and functionality in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to manage the configuration.

Before you begin:
- Verify that you are assigned the **Editor** platform access role and **Manager** server access role for {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}.
- Verify that you are assigned the **Administrator** platform access role and the **Manager** service access role for all Kubernetes namespaces in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} to create the monitoring configuration. To view a monitoring configuration or launch the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} dashboard after the monitoring configuration is created, users must be assigned the **Viewer** platform access role and **Reader** service access role for the `ibm-observe` Kubernetes namespace in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.
- If you want to use the CLI to set up the monitoring configuration:
  - [Install the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability CLI plug-in (`ibmcloud ob`)](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_install_steps).
  - [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To set up a monitoring configuration for your cluster:

1. Create an [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service instance](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-provision) and note the name of the instance. The service instance must belong to the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account where you created your cluster, but can be in a different resource group and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region than your cluster.
2. Set up a monitoring configuration for your cluster. When you create the monitoring configuration, a Kubernetes namespace `ibm-observe` is created and a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent is deployed as a Kubernetes daemon set to all worker nodes in your cluster. This agent collects cluster and pod metrics, such as the worker node CPU and memory usage, or the amount incoming and outgoing network traffic to your pods.

   - **From the console: **
     1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external}, select the cluster for which you want to create a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} configuration.
     2. On the cluster **Overview** page, click **Connect**.
     3. Select the region and the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service instance that you created earlier, and click **Connect**.

   - **From the CLI:**
     1. Create the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} configuration. When you create the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} configuration, the access key that was last added is retrieved automatically. If you want to use a different access key, add the `--sysdig-access-key <access_key>` option to the command.

        To use a different service access key after you created the monitoring configuration, use the [`ibmcloud ob monitoring config replace`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-observability_cli#monitoring_config_replace) command.
        {: tip}

        ```
        ibmcloud ob monitoring config create --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --instance <Monitoring_instance_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        Creating configuration...
        OK
        ```
        {: screen}

     2. Verify that the monitoring configuration was added to your cluster.
        ```
        ibmcloud ob monitoring config list --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        Listing configurations...

        OK
        Instance Name                Instance ID                            CRN   
        IBM Cloud Monitoring-aaa     1a111a1a-1111-11a1-a1aa-aaa11111a11a   crn:v1:prod:public:sysdig:us-south:a/a11111a1aaaaa11a111aa11a1aa1111a:1a111a1a-1111-11a1-a1aa-aaa11111a11a::  
        ```
        {: screen}

3. Optional: Verify that the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent was set up successfully.
   1. If you used the console to create the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} configuration, log in to your cluster. For more information, see [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
   2. Verify that the daemon set for the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent was created and all instances are listed as `AVAILABLE`.
      ```
      kubectl get daemon sets -n ibm-observe
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
      sysdig-agent   9         9         9       9            9           <none>          14m
      ```
      {: screen}

      The number of daemon set instances that are deployed equals the number of worker nodes in your cluster.

   3. Review the configmap that was created for your {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent.
      ```
      kubectl describe configmap -n ibm-observe
      ```
      {: pre}

4. Access the metrics for your pods and cluster from the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} dashboard.
   1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external}, select the cluster that you configured.
   2. On the cluster **Overview** page, click **Launch**. The {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} dashboard opens.
   3. Review the pod and cluster metrics that the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent collected from your cluster. It might take a few minutes for your first metrics to show.

5. Review how you can work with the [{{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} dashboard](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-panels) to further analyze your metrics.

## Viewing cluster states
{: #states}

Review the state of a Kubernetes cluster to get information about the availability and capacity of the cluster, and potential problems that might occur.
{: shortdesc}

To view information about a specific cluster, such as its zones, service endpoint URLs, Ingress subdomain, version, and owner, use the `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_get). Include the `--show-resources` flag to view more cluster resources such as add-ons for storage pods or subnet VLANs for public and private IPs.

You can review information about the overall cluster, the IBM-managed master, and your worker nodes. To troubleshoot your cluster and worker nodes, see [Troubleshooting clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot#debug_clusters).

### Cluster states

### Master states
{: #states_master}

Your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} includes an IBM-managed master with highly available replicas, automatic security patch updates applied for you, and automation in place to recover in case of an incident. You can check the health, status, and state of the cluster master by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.
{: shortdesc}

**Master Health**

The **Master Health** reflects the state of master components and notifies you if something needs your attention. The health might be one of the following:
*   `error`: The master is not operational. IBM is automatically notified and takes action to resolve this issue. You can continue monitoring the health until the master is `normal`. You can also [open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case](/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help).
*   `normal`: The master is operational and healthy. No action is required.
*   `unavailable`: The master might not be accessible, which means some actions such as resizing a worker pool are temporarily unavailable. IBM is automatically notified and takes action to resolve this issue. You can continue monitoring the health until the master is `normal`.
*   `unsupported`: The master runs an unsupported version of Kubernetes. You must [update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update) to return the master to `normal` health.

**Master Status and State**

The **Master Status** provides details of what operation from the master state is in progress. The status includes a timestamp of how long the master has been in the same state, such as `Ready (1 month ago)`. The **Master State** reflects the lifecycle of possible operations that can be performed on the master, such as deploying, updating, and deleting. Each state is described in the following table.

|Master state|Description|
|--- |--- |
|`deployed`|The master is successfully deployed. Check the status to verify that the master is `Ready` or to see if an update is available.|
|`deploying`|The master is currently deploying. Wait for the state to become `deployed` before working with your cluster, such as adding worker nodes.|
|`deploy_failed`|The master failed to deploy. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. Check the **Master Status** field for more information, or wait for the state to become `deployed`.|
|`deleting`|The master is currently deleting because you deleted the cluster. You cannot undo a deletion. After the cluster is deleted, you can no longer check the master state because the cluster is completely removed.|
|`delete_failed`|The master failed to delete. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You cannot resolve the issue by trying to delete the cluster again. Instead, check the **Master Status** field for more information, or wait for the cluster to delete. You can also [open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case](/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help).|
|`updating`|The master is updating its Kubernetes version. The update might be a patch update that is automatically applied, or a minor or major version that you applied by updating the cluster. During the update, your highly available master can continue processing requests, and your app workloads and worker nodes continue to run. After the master update is complete, you can [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).</br></br>If the update is unsuccessful, the master returns to a `deployed` state and continues running the previous version. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can check if the update failed in the **Master Status** field.|
|`update_cancelled`|The master update is canceled because the cluster was not in a healthy state at the time of the update. Your master remains in this state until your cluster is healthy and you manually update the master. To update the master, use the `ibmcloud ks cluster master update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update).If you do not want to update the master to the default `major.minor` version during the update, include the `--version` flag and specify the latest patch version that is available for the `major.minor` version that you want, such as `1.19.9`. To list available versions, run `ibmcloud ks versions`.|
|`update_failed`|The master update failed. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can continue to monitor the health of the master until the master reaches a normal state. If the master remains in this state for more than 1 day, [open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case](/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help). IBM Support might identify other issues in your cluster that you must fix before the master can be updated.|

## Monitoring worker node health in with Autorecovery
{: #autorecovery}

The Autorecovery system uses various checks to query worker node health status. If Autorecovery detects an unhealthy worker node based on the configured checks, Autorecovery triggers a corrective action like rebooting a VPC worker node or reloading the operating system in a classic worker node. Only one worker node undergoes a corrective action at a time. The worker node must successfully complete the corrective action before any other worker node undergoes a corrective action. For more information, see this [Autorecovery blog post](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/autorecovery-utilizes-consistent-hashing-high-availability){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

Autorecovery requires at least one healthy worker node to function properly. Configure Autorecovery with active checks only in clusters with two or more worker nodes.
{: note}

Before you begin:
- Ensure that you have the following [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform):
    - **Administrator** platform access role for the cluster
    - **Writer** or **Manager** service access role for the `kube-system` namespace
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To configure Autorecovery:

1.  [Follow the instructions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#install_v3) to install the Helm version 3 client on your local machine.

2. Create a configuration map file that defines your checks in JSON format. For example, the following YAML file defines three checks: an HTTP check and two Kubernetes API server checks. Refer to the tables following the example YAML file for information about the three kinds of checks and information about the individual components of the checks.<p class="tip">*Define each check as a unique key in the `data` section of the configuration map.</p>

   ```yaml
   kind: ConfigMap

You must implement a health check that is available at the <code>/myhealth</code> path and that can verify whether your HTTP server is healthy. You can define other paths by changing the <code>Route</code> parameter. If the HTTP server is healthy, you must return the HTTP response code that is defined in <code>ExpectedStatus</code>. The HTTP server must be configured to listen on the private IP address of the worker node. You can find the private IP address by running <code>kubectl get nodes</code>.<br></br>
   For example, consider two nodes in a cluster that have the private IP addresses 10.10.10.1 and 10.10.10.2. In this example, two routes are checked for a 200 HTTP response: <code>http://10.10.10.1:80/myhealth</code> and <code>http://10.10.10.2:80/myhealth</code>.
   The check in the example YAML runs every 3 minutes. If it fails three consecutive times, the worker node is rebooted. This action is equivalent to running <code>ibmcloud ks worker reboot</code>.<br></br>The HTTP check is disabled until you set the <b>Enabled</b> field to <code>true</code>.</td>

3. Create the configuration map in your cluster.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f ibm-worker-recovery-checks.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Verify that you created the configuration map with the name `ibm-worker-recovery-checks` in the `kube-system` namespace with the proper checks.
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system get cm ibm-worker-recovery-checks -o yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Deploy Autorecovery into your cluster by installing the `ibm-worker-recovery` Helm chart.
    ```
    helm install ibm-worker-recovery iks-charts/ibm-worker-recovery --namespace kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

6. After a few minutes, you can check the `Events` section in the output of the following command to see activity on the Autorecovery deployment.
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system describe deployment ibm-worker-recovery
    ```
    {: pre}

7. If you do not see activity on the Autorecovery deployment, you can check the Helm deployment by running the tests that are included in the Autorecovery chart definition.
    ```
    helm test ibm-worker-recovery -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}
