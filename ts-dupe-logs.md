Troubleshoot duplicate log entries appearing in your cluster logs.
{: shortdesc}



You are seeing duplicate log entries for your clusters.
{: tsSymptoms}


The most common cause for this issue is that you have multiple logging agents installed in your cluster.
{: tsCauses}


Remove the unsupported observability plug-in resources from your cluster.
{: tsResolve}


1. Check for the unsupported agents.
    ```sh
    kubectl get daemonsets -n ibm-observe
    ```
    {: pre}

1. If there is a `sysdig-agent`, remove it.

    Example output that shows the resources which need to be removed.
    ```sh
    NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
    sysdig-agent   9         9         9       9            9           <none>          4d
    ```
    {: screen}


1. Delete the resources.
    ```sh
    kubectl kubectl delete daemonset sysdig-agent -n ibm-observe
    ```
    {: pre}



1. Verify the daemonset and its pods were deleted.
    ```sh
    kubectl get daemonset sysdig-agent -n ibm-observe
    kubectl get pods -l app=sysdig-agent -n ibm-observe
    ```
    {: pre}
