# Version information and update actions   
{: #cs_versions}

## Kubernetes version types
{: #version_types}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} concurrently supports multiple versions of Kubernetes. When a latest version (n) is released, versions up to 2 behind (n-2) are supported. Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported.
{:shortdesc}

**Supported Kubernetes versions**:
*   Latest: 1.15.5
*   Default: 1.14.8
*   Other: 1.13.12

**Deprecated and unsupported Kubernetes versions**:
*   Deprecated: 1.12.10
*   Unsupported: 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11

</br>

**Deprecated versions**: When clusters are running on a deprecated Kubernetes version, you have a minimum of 45 days to review and update to a supported Kubernetes version before the version becomes unsupported. During the deprecation period, your cluster is still functional, but might require updates to a supported release to fix security vulnerabilities. For example, you can add and reload worker nodes, but you cannot create new clusters that use the deprecated version when the unsupported date is 45 or less days away.

**Unsupported versions**: If your clusters run a Kubernetes version that is not supported, review the following potential update impacts and then immediately [update the cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#update) to continue receiving important security updates and support. Unsupported clusters cannot add or reload existing worker nodes. You can find out whether your cluster is **unsupported** by reviewing the **State** field in the output of the `ibmcloud ks cluster ls` command or in the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).

If you wait until your cluster is three or more minor versions behind the oldest supported version, you cannot update the cluster. Instead, [create a new cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters), [deploy your apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#app) to the new cluster, and [delete](/docs/containers?topic=containers-remove) the unsupported cluster.<br><br>To avoid this issue, update deprecated clusters to a supported version less than three ahead of the current version, such as 1.11 to 1.12 and then update to the latest version, 1.14. If the worker nodes run a version three or more behind the master, you might see your pods fail by entering a state such as `MatchNodeSelector`, `CrashLoopBackOff`, or `ContainerCreating` until you update the worker nodes to the same version as the master. After you update from a deprecated to a supported version, your cluster can resume normal operations and continue receiving support.
{: important}

</br>

To check the server version of a cluster, run the following command.
```
kubectl version  --short | grep -i server
```
{: pre}

Example output:
```
Server Version: v1.14.8+IKS
```

## Update types
{: #update_types}

Your Kubernetes cluster has three types of updates: major, minor, and patch.
{:shortdesc}

|Update type|Examples of version labels|Updated by|Impact
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Major|1.x.x|You|Operation changes for clusters, including scripts or deployments.|
|Minor|x.9.x|You|Operation changes for clusters, including scripts or deployments.|
|Patch|x.x.4_1510|IBM and you|Kubernetes patches, as well as other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider component updates such as security and operating system patches. IBM updates masters automatically, but you apply patches to worker nodes. See more about patches in the following section.|
{: caption="Impacts of Kubernetes updates" caption-side="top"}

As updates become available, you are notified when you view information about the worker nodes, such as with the `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster>` or `ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster> --worker <worker>` commands.
-  **Major and minor updates (1.x)**: First, [update your master node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master) and then [update the worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node). Worker nodes cannot run a Kubernetes major or minor version that is greater than the masters.
   - You cannot update a Kubernetes master three or more minor versions ahead. For example, if your current master is version 1.11 and you want to update to 1.14, you must update to 1.12 first.
   - If you use a `kubectl` CLI version that does match at least the `major.minor` version of your clusters, you might experience unexpected results. Make sure to keep your Kubernetes cluster and [CLI versions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) up-to-date.
-  **Patch updates (x.x.4_1510)**: Changes across patches are documented in the [Version changelog](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog). Master patches are applied automatically, but you initiate worker node patches updates. Worker nodes can also run patch versions that are greater than the masters. As updates become available, you are notified when you view information about the master and worker nodes in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or CLI, such as with the following commands: `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`, `cluster get`, `workers`, or `worker get`.
   - **Worker node patches**: Check monthly to see whether an update is available, and use the `ibmcloud ks worker update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update) or the `ibmcloud ks worker reload` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) to apply these security and operating system patches. During an update or reload, your worker node machine is reimaged, and data is deleted if not [stored outside the worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).
   - **Master patches**: Master patches are applied automatically over the course of several days, so a master patch version might show up as available before it is applied to your master. The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, as noted in the changelog, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another. In any of these cases, you can choose to safely use the `ibmcloud ks cluster master update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.

</br>

## Release history
{: #release-history}

The following table records {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} version release history. You can use this information for planning purposes, such as to estimate general time frames when a certain release might become unsupported. After the Kubernetes community releases a version update, the IBM team begins a process of hardening and testing the release for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} environments. Availability and unsupported release dates depend on the results of these tests, community updates, security patches, and technology changes between versions. Plan to keep your cluster master and worker node version up-to-date according to the `n-2` version support policy.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} was first generally available with Kubernetes version 1.5. Projected release or unsupported dates are subject to change. To go to the version update preparation steps, click the version number.

Dates that are marked with a dagger (`†`) are tentative and subject to change.

<td>The container runtime interface (CRI) changed the pod log directory structure from `/var/log/pods/<UID>` to `/var/log/pods/<NAMESPACE_NAME_UID>`. If your apps bypass Kubernetes and the CRI to access pod logs directly on worker nodes, update them to handle both directory structures. Accessing pod logs via Kubernetes, for example by running `kubectl logs`, is not impacted by this change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Health checks no longer follow redirects</td>
<td>Health check liveness and readiness probes that use an `HTTPGetAction` no longer follow redirects to hostnames that are different from the original probe request. Instead, these non-local redirects return a `Success` response and an event with reason `ProbeWarning` is generated to indicate that the redirect was ignored. If you previously relied on the redirect to run health checks against different hostname endpoints, you must perform the health check logic outside the `kubelet`. For example, you might proxy the external endpoint instead of redirecting the probe request.</td>

<td>Unsupported: KubeDNS cluster DNS provider</td>
<td>CoreDNS is now the only supported cluster DNS provider for clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.14 and later. If you update an existing cluster that uses KubeDNS as the cluster DNS provider to version 1.14, KubeDNS is automatically migrated to CoreDNS during the update. Thus before you update the cluster, consider [setting up CoreDNS as the cluster DNS provider](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster_dns#set_coredns) and testing it. For example, if your app relies on an older DNS client, you might need to [update the app or customize CoreDNS](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_network#coredns_issues).<br><br>CoreDNS supports [cluster DNS specification ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md#25---records-for-external-name-services) to enter a domain name as the Kubernetes service `ExternalName` field.

<td>Unsupported: The Kubernetes API swagger documents</td>
<td>The `swagger/*`, `/swagger.json`, and `/swagger-2.0.0.pb-v1` schema API docs are now removed in favor of the `/openapi/v2` schema API docs. The swagger docs were deprecated when the OpenAPI docs became available in Kubernetes version 1.10. Additionally, the Kubernetes API server now aggregates only OpenAPI schemas from `/openapi/v2` endpoints of aggregated API servers. The fallback to aggregate from `/swagger.json` is removed. If you installed apps that provide Kubernetes API extensions, ensure that your apps support the `/openapi/v2` schema API docs.</td>

<tr>
<td>Kubernetes Metrics Server</td>
<td>If you currently have the Kubernetes `metric-server` deployed in your cluster, you must remove the `metric-server` before you update the cluster to Kubernetes 1.12. This removal prevents conflicts with the `metric-server` that is deployed during the update.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Role bindings for `kube-system` `default` service account</td>
<td>The `kube-system` `default` service account no longer has **cluster-admin** access to the Kubernetes API. If you deploy features or add-ons such as [Helm](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#public_helm_install) that require access to processes in your cluster, set up a [service account ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/). If you need time to create and set up individual service accounts with the appropriate permissions, you can temporarily grant the **cluster-admin** role with the following cluster role binding: `kubectl create clusterrolebinding kube-system:default --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default`</td>

<tr>
<td>APIs for Kubernetes</td>
<td>The Kubernetes API replaces deprecated APIs as follows:
<ul><li><strong>apps/v1</strong>: The `apps/v1` Kubernetes API replaces the `apps/v1beta1` and `apps/v1alpha` APIs. The `apps/v1` API also replaces the `extensions/v1beta1` API for `daemonset`, `deployment`, `replicaset`, and `statefulset` resources. The Kubernetes project is deprecating and phasing out support for the previous APIs from the Kubernetes `apiserver` and the `kubectl` client.</li>
<li><strong>networking.k8s.io/v1</strong>: The `networking.k8s.io/v1` API replaces the `extensions/v1beta1` API for NetworkPolicy resources.</li>
<li><strong>policy/v1beta1</strong>: The `policy/v1beta1` API replaces the `extensions/v1beta1` API for `podsecuritypolicy` resources.</li></ul>
<br><br>Update all your YAML `apiVersion` fields to use the appropriate Kubernetes API before the deprecated APIs become unsupported. Also, review the [Kubernetes docs ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for changes that are related to `apps/v1`, such as the following.
<ul><li>After creating a deployment, the `.spec.selector` field is immutable.</li>
<li>The `.spec.rollbackTo` field is deprecated. Instead, use the `kubectl rollout undo` command.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CoreDNS available as cluster DNS provider</td>
<td>The Kubernetes project is in the process of transitioning to support CoreDNS instead of the current Kubernetes DNS (KubeDNS). In version 1.12, the default cluster DNS remains KubeDNS, but you can [choose to use CoreDNS](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster_dns#dns_set).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`kubectl apply --force`</td>
<td>Now, when you force an apply action (`kubectl apply --force`) on resources that cannot be updated, such as immutable fields in YAML files, the resources are recreated instead. If your scripts rely on the previous behavior, update them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`kubectl get componentstatuses`</td>
<td>The `kubectl get componentstatuses` command does not properly report the health of some Kubernetes master components because these components are no longer accessible from the Kubernetes API server now that `localhost` and insecure (HTTP) ports are disabled. After introducing highly available (HA) masters in Kubernetes version 1.10, each Kubernetes master is set up with multiple `apiserver`, `controller-manager`, `scheduler`, and `etcd` instances. Instead, review the cluster healthy by checking the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/landing) or by using the `ibmcloud ks cluster get` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_get).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`kubectl logs --interactive`</td>
<td>The `--interactive` flag is no longer supported for `kubectl logs`. Update any automation that uses this flag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`kubectl patch`</td>
<td>If the `patch` command results in no changes (a redundant patch), the command no longer exits with a `1` return code. If your scripts rely on the previous behavior, update them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`kubectl version -c`</td>
<td>The `-c` shorthand flag is no longer supported. Instead, use the full `--client` flag. Update any automation that uses this flag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`kubectl wait`</td>
<td>If no matching selectors are found, the command now prints an error message and exits with a `1` return code. If your scripts rely on the previous behavior, update them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>kubelet cAdvisor port</td>
<td>The [Container Advisor (cAdvisor) ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) web UI that the kubelet used by starting the `--cadvisor-port` is removed from Kubernetes 1.12. If you still need to run cAdvisor, [deploy cAdvisor as a daemon set ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/google/cadvisor/tree/master/deploy/kubernetes).<br><br>In the daemon set, specify the ports section so that cAdvisor can be reached via `http://node-ip:4194`, such as follows. The cAdvisor pods fail until the worker nodes are updated to 1.12 because earlier versions of kubelet use host port 4194 for cAdvisor.
<pre class="screen"><code>ports:
          - name: http

<td id="metrics-server">Kubernetes Metrics Server</td>
<td>Kubernetes Metrics Server replaces Kubernetes Heapster (deprecated since Kubernetes version 1.8) as the cluster metrics provider. If you run more than 30 pods per worker node in your cluster, [adjust the `metrics-server` configuration for performance](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kernel#metrics).
<p>The Kubernetes dashboard does not work with the `metrics-server`. If you want to display metrics in a dashboard, choose from the following options.</p>
<ul><li>[Set up Grafana to analyze metrics](/docs/services/cloud-monitoring/tutorials?topic=cloud-monitoring-container_service_metrics#container_service_metrics) by using the Cluster Monitoring Dashboard.</li>
<li>Deploy [Heapster ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](	https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster) to your cluster.
