# Version information and update actions
{: #cs_versions}

## Kubernetes version types
{: #version_types}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} concurrently supports multiple versions of Kubernetes. When a latest version (n) is released, versions up to 2 behind (n-2) are supported. Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported.
{:shortdesc}

The current supported Kubernetes versions are:

- Latest: 1.10.3
- Default: 1.9.8
- Supported: 1.8.13

**Deprecated Versions**: When clusters are running on a deprecated Kubernetes, you have 30 days to review and update to a supported Kubernetes version before the version becomes unsupported. During the deprecation period, you can run limited commands in your clusters to add workers, reload workers, and update the cluster. You cannot create new clusters in the deprecated version.

**Unsupported Versions**: If you are running clusters on a Kubernetes version that is not supported, [review potential impacts](#version_types) for updates and then immediately [update the cluster](cs_cluster_update.html#update) to continue receiving important security updates and support.

To check the server version of a cluster, run the following command.

```
kubectl version  --short | grep -i server
```
{: pre}

Example output:

```
Server Version: v1.9.8+9d6e0610086578
```
{: screen}


## Update types
{: #update_types}

Your Kubernetes cluster has three types of updates: major, minor, and patch.
{:shortdesc}

|Update type|Examples of version labels|Updated by|Impact
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Major|1.x.x|You|Operation changes for clusters, including scripts or deployments.|
|Minor|x.9.x|You|Operation changes for clusters, including scripts or deployments.|
|Patch|x.x.4_1510|IBM and you|Kubernetes patches, as well as other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Provider component updates such as security and operating system patches. IBM updates masters automatically, but you apply patches to worker nodes.|
{: caption="Impacts of Kubernetes updates" caption-side="top"}

As updates become available, you are notified when you view information about the worker nodes, such as with the `ibmcloud cs workers <cluster>` or `ibmcloud cs worker-get <cluster> <worker>` commands.
-  **Major and minor updates**: First, [update your master node](cs_cluster_update.html#master) and then [update the worker nodes](cs_cluster_update.html#worker_node).
   - By default, you cannot update a Kubernetes master three or more minor versions ahead. For example, if your current master is version 1.5 and you want to update to 1.8, you must update to 1.7 first. You can force the update to continue, but updating more than two minor versions might cause unexpected results.
   - If you use a `kubectl` CLI version that does match at least the `major.minor` version of your clusters, you might experience unexpected results. Make sure to keep your Kubernetes cluster and [CLI versions](cs_cli_install.html#kubectl) up-to-date.
-  **Patch updates**: Check monthly to see whether an update is available, and use the `ibmcloud cs worker-update` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_update) or the `ibmcloud cs worker-reload` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_reload) to apply these security and operating system patches. For more information, see [Version changelog](cs_versions_changelog.html).

Review changes that you might need to make when you are updating from the previous Kubernetes version to 1.10.

**Important**: Before you can successfully update to Kubernetes 1.10, you must follow the steps listed in [Preparing to update to Calico v3](#110_calicov3).

### Preparing to update to Calico v3
{: #110_calicov3}

Before you begin, your cluster master and all worker nodes must be running Kubernetes version 1.8 or later, and must have at least one worker node.

**Important**: Prepare for the Calico v3 update before you update the master. During the master upgrade to Kubernetes v1.10, new pods and new Kubernetes or Calico network policies are not scheduled. The amount of time that the update prevents new scheduling varies. Small clusters can take a few minutes, with a few extra minutes for every 10 nodes. Existing network policies and pods continue to run.

1.  Verify that your Calico pods are healthy.
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=calico-node -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

2.  If any pod is not in a **Running** state, delete the pod and wait until it is in a **Running** state before you continue.

3.  If you auto-generate Calico policies or other Calico resources, update your automation tooling to generate these resources with [Calico v3 syntax ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/calicoctl/resources/).

4.  If you use [strongSwan](cs_vpn.html#vpn-setup) for VPN connectivity, the strongSwan 2.0.0 Helm chart does not work with Calico v3 or Kubernetes 1.10. [Update strongSwan](cs_vpn.html#vpn_upgrade) to the 2.1.0 Helm chart, which is backward compatible with Calico 2.6, and Kubernetes 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9.

5.  [Update your cluster master to Kubernetes v1.10](cs_cluster_update.html#master).

<br />


## Version 1.9

### Version 1.7 (Deprecated)
{: #cs_v17}

**As of 22 May 2018, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.7 are deprecated**. After 21 June 2018, Version 1.7 clusters cannot receive security updates or support unless they are updated to the next most recent version ([Kubernetes 1.8](#cs_v18)).

[Review potential impact](cs_versions.html#cs_versions) of each Kubernetes version update, and then [update your clusters](cs_cluster_update.html#update) immediately.

Are you still running Kubernetes version 1.5? Review the following information to assess the impact of updating your cluster from v1.5 to v1.7. [Update your clusters](cs_cluster_update.html#update) to v1.7, then immediately update them to at least v1.8.

### Version 1.5 (Unsupported)
{: #cs_v1-5}

As of 4 April 2018, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} clusters that run [Kubernetes version 1.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.5.md) are unsupported. Version 1.5 clusters cannot receive security updates or support unless they are updated to the next most recent version ([Kubernetes 1.7](#cs_v17)).

[Review potential impact](cs_versions.html#cs_versions) of each Kubernetes version update, and then [update your clusters](cs_cluster_update.html#update) immediately. You must update from one version to the next most recent, such as 1.5 to 1.7 or 1.8 to 1.9.
