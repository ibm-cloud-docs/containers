# Why can't my app access or write to PVCs?

When you mount a PVC to your pod, you might experience errors when accessing or writing to the PVC.
{: shortdesc}

1. List the pods in your cluster and review the status of the pod.
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Find the root cause for why your app cannot access or write to the PVC.
    ```sh
    kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    kubectl logs <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Review common errors that can occur when you mount a PVC to a pod.

| Symptom or error message | Description | Steps to resolve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your pod is stuck in a `ContainerCreating` state. `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume ... read-only file system`. | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure back end experienced network problems. To protect your data and to avoid data corruption, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automatically disconnected the file storage server to prevent write operations on NFS file shares. | See [File storage: File systems for worker nodes change to read-only](/docs/containers?topic=containers-readonly_nodes) |
| `write-permission` `do not have required permission` `cannot create directory '/bitnami/mariadb/data': Permission denied` | In your deployment, you specified a non-root user to own the NFS file storage mount path. By default, non-root users do not have write permission on the volume mount path for NFS-backed storage. | See [File storage: App fails when a non-root user owns the NFS file storage mount path](/docs/containers?topic=containers-nonroot) |
| After you specified a non-root user to own the NFS file storage mount path or deployed a Helm chart with a non-root user ID specified, the user cannot write to the mounted storage. | The deployment or Helm chart configuration specifies the security context for the pod's `fsGroup` (group ID) and `runAsUser` (user ID) | See [File storage: Adding non-root user access to persistent storage fails](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_storage_nonroot) |
