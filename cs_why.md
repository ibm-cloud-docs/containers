# Why {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
{: #cs_ov}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} delivers powerful tools by combining Docker containers, the Kubernetes technology, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to automate the deployment, operation, scaling, and monitoring of containerized apps in a cluster of compute hosts.
{:shortdesc}


## Benefits of using the service
{: #benefits}

Clusters are deployed on compute hosts that provide native Kubernetes and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-specific capabilities.
{:shortdesc}

|Benefit|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Single-tenant Kubernetes clusters with compute, network, and storage infrastructure isolation|<ul><li>Create your own customized infrastructure that meets the requirements of your organization.</li><li>Provision a dedicated and secured Kubernetes master, worker nodes, virtual networks, and storage by using the resources provided by IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer).</li><li>Fully managed Kubernetes master that is continuously monitored and updated by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to keep your cluster available.</li><li>Option to provision worker nodes as bare metal servers with Trusted Compute.</li><li>Store persistent data, share data between Kubernetes pods, and restore data when needed with the integrated and secure volume service.</li><li>Benefit from full support for all native Kubernetes APIs.</li></ul>|
| Multizone clusters to increase high availability | <ul><li>Easily manage worker nodes of the same machine type (CPU, memory, virtual or physical) with worker pools.</li><li>Guard against zone failure by spreading nodes evenly across select multizones and using anti-affinity pod deployments for your apps.</li><li>Decrease your costs by using multizone clusters instead of duplicating the resources in a separate cluster.</li><li>Benefit from automatic load balancing across apps with the multizone load balancer (MZLB) that is set up automatically for you in each zone of the cluster.</li></ul>|
|Image security compliance with Vulnerability Advisor|<ul><li>Set up your own repo in our secured Docker private image registry where images are stored and shared by all users in the organization.</li><li>Benefit from automatic scanning of images in your private {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} registry.</li><li>Review recommendations specific to the operating system used in the image to fix potential vulnerabilities.</li></ul>|
|Continuous monitoring of the cluster health|<ul><li>Use the cluster dashboard to quickly see and manage the health of your cluster, worker nodes, and container deployments.</li><li>Find detailed consumption metrics by using {{site.data.keyword.monitoringlong}} and quickly expand your cluster to meet work loads.</li><li>Review logging information by using {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong}} to see detailed cluster activities.</li></ul>|
|Secure exposure of apps to the public|<ul><li>Choose between a public IP address, an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provided route, or your own custom domain to access services in your cluster from the internet.</li></ul>|
|{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service integration|<ul><li>Add extra capabilities to your app through the integration of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, such as Watson APIs, Blockchain, data services, or Internet of Things.</li></ul>|

## Comparison of free and standard clusters
{: #cluster_types}

You can create one free cluster or any number of standard clusters. Try out free clusters to get familiar with a few Kubernetes capabilities, or create standard clusters to use the full capabilities of Kubernetes to deploy apps. Free clusters are automatically deleted after 30 days.
{:shortdesc}

If you have a free cluster and want to upgrade to a standard cluster, you can [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui). Then, deploy any YAMLs for the Kubernetes resources that you made with your free cluster into the standard cluster.
