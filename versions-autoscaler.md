# Cluster autoscaler add-on changelog
{: #ca_changelog}

View information for patch updates to the cluster autoscaler add-on in your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters.
{: shortdesc}

Patch updates
:   Patch updates are delivered automatically by IBM and don't contain any feature updates or changes in the supported add-on and cluster versions.

Release updates
:   Release updates contain new features for the cluster autoscaler or changes in the supported add-on or cluster versions. You must manually apply release updates to your cluster autoscaler add-on. To update your cluster autoscaler add-on, see [Updating the cluster autoscaler add-on](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-install-addon#cluster-scaling-update-addon).

Refer to the following tables for a summary of changes for each version of the [cluster autoscaler add-on](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-classic-vpc).

As of 23 June 2021, version `1.0.2` of the cluster autoscaler add-on is deprecated and becomes unsupported on 23 July 2021. Version `1.0.3`, which adds support for Kubernetes 1.21 is now available. If you have a deprecated or unsupported version of the add-on installed in your cluster, update the add-on to version `1.0.3`. To update the add-on in your cluster, disable the add-on and then re-enable the add-on. You might see a warning that resources or data might be deleted. For the cluster autoscaler update, any autoscaling operations that are in process when you disable the add-on fail. When you re-enable the add-on, autoscaling operations are restarted for you. Existing cluster autoscaler resources like the `iks-ca-configmap` are retained even after you disable the add-on. Your worker nodes are not deleted because of disabling the add-on.
