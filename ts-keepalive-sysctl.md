# Why does my pod with long running TCP connections get disconnected?
{: #ts-keepalive-sysctl}
{: support}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}

When a pod has long running TCP connections and the pod is idle for a period of time, it occasionally gets disconnected.
{: tsSymptoms}

The idle time might have exceeded the limit that is defined by the `sysctl` keepalive settings for the pod.
{: tsCauses}

Try updating the the `sysctl` keepalive settings for the pod. For more information, see [Optimizing network keepalive `sysctl` settings](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kernel#keepalive-iks).
