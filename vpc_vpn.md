# VPC: Setting up VPN connectivity
{: #vpc-vpnaas}

<img src="images/icon-vpc.png" alt="VPC infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> This VPN information is specific to VPC clusters. For VPN information for classic clusters, see [Setting up VPN connectivity](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpn).
{: note}

With VPN connectivity, you can securely connect apps and services in a VPC cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to on-premises networks, other VPCs, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure resources. You can also connect apps that are external to your cluster to an app that runs inside your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

## Choosing a VPN solution
{: #options}

Choose a VPC VPN connection solution based on which resources or networks you want to connect your cluster to.
{: shortdesc}

### Communication with resources in on-premises data centers
{: #onprem}

To connect your cluster with your on-premises data center, you can set up the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} VPN service.
{: shortdesc}

With the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} VPN, you connect an entire VPC to an on-premises data center or to another VPC. This option allows you to remain VPC-native in you VPN connection setup. To get started:
1. [Configure an on-prem VPN gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-onprem-example#configuring-onprem-gateway).
2. [Create a VPN gateway in your VPC, and create the connection between the VPC VPN gateway and your local VPN gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console#vpn-ui). If you have a multizone cluster, you must create a VPC gateway on a subnet in each zone where you have worker nodes.

If you plan to connect your cluster to on-premises networks, you might have subnet conflicts with the IBM-provided default 172.30.0.0/16 range for pods and 172.21.0.0/16 range for services. You can avoid subnet conflicts when you [create a cluster in the CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cli_cluster-create-vpc-classic) by specifying a custom subnet CIDR for pods in the `--pod-subnet` flag and a custom subnet CIDR for services in the `--service-subnet` flag.
{: tip}

### Communication with resources in other VPCs
{: #vpc-vpc}

To connect an entire VPC to another VPC in your account, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} VPN.
{: shortdesc}

For example, you can connect subnets in a VPC in one region through a VPN connection to subnets in a VPC in another region. To get started: by creating a VPC gateway for your subnets, see [Using VPN with your VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-onprem-example). Note that if you use [access control lists (ACLs)](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy) for your VPC subnets, you must create inbound or outbound rules to allow your worker nodes to communicate with the subnets in other VPCs.

### Communication with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic resources
{: #vpc-classic}

If you need to connect your cluster to resources in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure, you can set up access between a VPC and one {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic infrastructure account.
{: shortdesc}

Before you connect a VPC to a classic infrastructure account, note the following limitations and requirements:
* You must enable the VPC for classic access when you create the VPC. You cannot convert an existing VPC to use classic access.
* You can set up classic infrastructure access for only one VPC per region. You cannot set up more than one VPC with classic infrastructure access in a region.
* [Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)](/docs/resources?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud) is required in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

To get started, see [Setting up access to your Classic Infrastructure from VPC](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-setting-up-access-to-your-classic-infrastructure-from-vpc).

When you create a VPC with classic infrastructure access, you can set up an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link) connection between your classic infrastructure and your remote networks. Any clusters that you create in the VPC with classic infrastructure access can access the Direct Link connection.
