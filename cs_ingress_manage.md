# Managing the Ingress ALB lifecycle
{: #ingress-manage}

Manage the lifecycle of your Ingress application load balancers (ALBs).
{: shortdesc}

Looking to change your ALBs' basic behavior or tune ALB performance? See [Modifying default Ingress settings](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress-settings).
{: tip}

## Updating ALBs
{: #alb-update}


Manage automatic updates of all Ingress ALB pods in a cluster.
{: shortdesc}

By default, automatic updates to Ingress ALBs are enabled. ALB pods are automatically updated when a new image version is available.

You can disable or enable the automatic updates for all Ingress ALBs in your cluster.
* To disable automatic updates:
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb autoupdate disable -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}
* To re-enable automatic updates:
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb autoupdate enable -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

If automatic updates for the Ingress ALB add-on are disabled and you want to update the add-on, you can force a one-time update of your ALB pods by running `ibmcloud ks alb update -c <cluster_name_or_ID>`. When you choose to manually update the add-on, all ALB pods in the cluster are updated to the latest image version. You cannot update an individual ALB or choose which image version to update the add-on to. For example, you cannot change your ALB image to another type when you manually update. Automatic updates remain disabled.

If your ALB pods were recently updated, but a custom configuration for your ALBs is affected by the latest version, you can roll back the update to the version that your ALB pods were previously running. After you roll back an update, automatic updates for ALB pods remain disabled.
```
ibmcloud ks alb rollback --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
```
{: pre}

## Scaling ALBs
{: #scale_albs}

When you create a standard cluster, one public and one private ALB is created in each zone where you have worker nodes. Each ALB can handle 32,768 connections per second. However, if you must process more than 32,768 connections per second, you can scale up your ALBs by increasing the number of ALB pod replicas or by creating more ALBs.
{: shortdesc}

### Increasing the number of ALB pod replicas
{: #alb_replicas}

By default, each ALB has 2 replicas. Scale up your ALB processing capabilities by increasing the number of ALB pods.
{: shortdesc}

1. Get the IDs for your ALBs.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb ls -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Create a YAML file for an `ibm-ingress-deploy-config` configmap. For each ALB, add `'{"replicas":<number_of_replicas>}'`. Example for increasing the number of ALB pods to 4 replicas:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-ingress-deploy-config
     namespace: kube-system
   data:
     <alb1-id>: '{"replicas":<number_of_replicas>}'
     <alb2-id>: '{"replicas":<number_of_replicas>}'
     ...
   ```
   {: screen}

3. Create the `ibm-ingress-deploy-config` configmap in your cluster.
  ```
  kubectl create -f ibm-ingress-deploy-config.yaml
  ```
  {: pre}

4. To pick up the changes, update your ALBs.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb update -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Verify that the number of ALB pods that are `Ready` are increased to the number of replicas that you specified.
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep alb
  ```
  {: pre}

### Creating more ALBs
{: #create_alb}

Scale up your ALB processing capabilities by creating more ALBs.
{: shortdesc}

For example, if you have worker nodes in `dal10`, a default public ALB exists in `dal10`. This default public ALB is deployed as two pods on two worker nodes in that zone. However, to handle more connections per second, you want to increase the number of ALBs in `dal10`. You can create a second public ALB in `dal10`. This ALB is also deployed as two pods on two worker nodes in `dal10`. All public ALBs in your cluster share the same IBM-assigned Ingress subdomain, so the IP address of the new ALB is automatically added to your Ingress subdomain. You do not need to change your Ingress resource files.

You can also use these steps to create more ALBs across zones in your cluster. When you create a multizone cluster, a default public ALB is created in each zone where you have worker nodes. However, default public ALBs are created in only up to three zones. If, for example, you later remove one of these original three zones and add workers in a different zone, a default public ALB is not created in that new zone. You can manually create an ALB to process connections in that new zone.
{: tip}

**Classic clusters:**

1. In each zone where you have worker nodes, create an ALB.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb create --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --type <public_or_private> --zone <zone> --vlan <VLAN_ID> [--user-ip <IP_address>] [--version image_version]
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```
  {: screen}

3. If you later decide to scale down your ALBs, you can disable an ALB. For example, you might want to disable an ALB to use less compute resources on your worker nodes. The ALB is disabled and does not route traffic in your cluster. You can re-enable an ALB at any time by running `ibmcloud ks alb configure classic --alb-id <ALB_ID> --enable`.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb configure classic --alb-id <ALB_ID> --disable

## Moving ALBs across VLANs
{: #migrate-alb-vlan}

<img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> The information in this topic is specific to classic clusters only.
{: note}

When you [change your worker node VLAN connections](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_cluster#change-vlans), the worker nodes are connected to the new VLAN and assigned new public or private IP addresses. However, ALBs cannot automatically migrate to the new VLAN because they are assigned a stable, portable public or private IP address from a subnet that belongs to the old VLAN. When your worker nodes and ALBs are connected to different VLANs, the ALBs cannot forward incoming network traffic to app pods to your worker nodes. To move your ALBs to a different VLAN, you must create an ALB on the new VLAN and disable the ALB on the old VLAN.
{: shortdesc}

Note that all public ALBs in your cluster share the same IBM-assigned Ingress subdomain. When you create new ALBs, you do not need to change your Ingress resource files.

1. Get the new public or private VLAN that you changed your worker node connections to in each zone.
  1. List the details for a worker in a zone.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

  2. In the output, note the **ID** for the public or the private VLAN.
    * To create public ALBs, note the public VLAN ID.
    * To create private ALBs, note the private VLAN ID.

  3. Repeat these steps for a worker in each zone so that you have the IDs for the new public or private VLAN in each zone.

2. In each zone, create an ALB on the new VLAN.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb create --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --type <public_or_private> --zone <zone> --vlan <VLAN_ID> [--user-ip <IP_address>] [--version image_version]

## Increasing the restart readiness check time for ALB pods
{: #readiness-check}

Increase the amount of time that ALB pods have to parse large Ingress resource files when the ALB pods restart.
{: shortdesc}

When an ALB pod restarts, such as after an update is applied, a readiness check prevents the ALB pod from attempting to route traffic requests until all of the Ingress resource files are parsed. This readiness check prevents request loss when ALB pods restart. By default, the readiness check waits 15 seconds after the pod restarts to start checking whether all Ingress files are parsed. If all files are parsed 15 seconds after the pod restarts, the ALB pod begins to route traffic requests again. If all files are not parsed 15 seconds after the pod restarts, the pod does not route traffic, and the readiness check continues to check every 15 seconds for a maximum timeout of 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the ALB pod begins to route traffic.

If you have very large Ingress resource files, it might take longer than 5 minutes for all of the files to be parsed. You can change the default values for the readiness check interval rate and for the total maximum readiness check timeout by adding the `ingress-resource-creation-rate` and `ingress-resource-timeout` settings to the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap.

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system

2. In the **data** section, add the `ingress-resource-creation-rate` and `ingress-resource-timeout` settings. Values can be formatted as seconds (`s`) and minutes (`m`). Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ingress-resource-creation-rate: 1m
     ingress-resource-timeout: 6m
     keep-alive: 8s
     private-ports: 80;443
     public-ports: 80;443
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.
   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
