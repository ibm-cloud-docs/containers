## Classic: Installing the IBM Cloud Block Storage Attacher plug-in (beta)
{: #block_storage_attacher}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage Attacher plug-in to attach raw, unformatted, and unmounted block storage to a classic worker node in your cluster.  
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage Attacher plug-in is available for classic worker nodes only. If you want to attach raw, unformatted block storage to a VPC worker node, see [Adding raw {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} to VPC worker nodes](#vpc_api_attach).
{: note}

For example, you want to store your data with a software-defined storage solution (SDS), such as [Portworx](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx), but you do not want to use classic bare metal worker nodes that are optimized for SDS usage and that come with extra local disks. To add local disks to your classic non-SDS worker node, you must manually create your block storage devices in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure account and use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher to attach the storage to your non-SDS worker node.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher plug-in creates pods on every worker node in your cluster as part of a daemon set and sets up a Kubernetes storage class that you later use to attach the block storage device to your non-SDS worker node.

Looking for instructions for how to update or remove the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher plug-in? See [Updating the plug-in](#update_block_attacher) and [Removing the plug-in](#remove_block_attacher).
{: tip}

1.  [Follow the instructions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#public_helm_install) to install the Helm client on your local machine, and install the Helm server (tiller) with a service account in your cluster.

2.  Verify that tiller is installed with a service account.

    ```
    kubectl get serviceaccount -n kube-system | grep tiller
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    NAME                                 SECRETS   AGE
    tiller                               1         2m
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Update the Helm repo to retrieve the latest version of all Helm charts in this repo.
   ```
   helm repo update
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.
   ```
   helm install iks-charts/ibm-block-storage-attacher --name block-attacher
   ```

## Classic: Automatically provisioning unformatted block storage and authorizing your worker nodes to access the storage
{: #automatic_block}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher plug-in to automatically add raw, unformatted, and unmounted block storage with the same configuration to all classic worker nodes in your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage Attacher plug-in is available for classic worker nodes only. If you want to attach raw, unformatted block storage to a VPC worker node, see [Adding raw {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} to VPC worker nodes](#vpc_api_attach).
{: note}

The `mkpvyaml` container that is included in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher plug-in is configured to run a script that finds all worker nodes in your cluster, creates raw block storage in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure portal, and then authorizes the worker nodes to access the storage.

To add different block storage configurations, add block storage to a subset of worker nodes only, or to have more control over the provisioning process, choose to [manually add block storage](#manual_block).
{: tip}


1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and target the resource group that your cluster is in.
   ```
   ibmcloud login
   ```
   {: pre}

2.  Clone the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Storage Utilities repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/IBM/ibmcloud-storage-utilities.git
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Navigate in to the `block-storage-utilities` directory.
   ```
   cd ibmcloud-storage-utilities/block-storage-provisioner
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Open the `yamlgen.yaml` file and specify the block storage configuration that you want to add to every worker node in the cluster.
   ```yaml
   #
   # Can only specify 'performance' OR 'endurance' and associated clause
   #
   cluster:  <cluster_name>    #  Enter the name of your cluster
   region:   <region>          #  Enter the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service region where you created your cluster
   type:  <storage_type>       #  Enter the type of storage that you want to provision. Choose between "performance" or "endurance"
   offering: storage_as_a_service   
   # performance:

5. Retrieve your IBM Cloud infrastructure username and API key. The username and API key are used by the `mkpvyaml` script to access the cluster.
   1.  Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external}.
   2.  From the menu bar, select **Manage > Access (IAM)**.
   3.  Select the **Users** tab and then click on your username.
   4.  In the **API keys** pane, find the entry **Classic infrastructure API key** and click the **Actions menu** ![Action menu icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Action menu icon") **> Details**.
   5.  Copy the API username and API key.

6. Store the credentials in an environment variable.
   1. Add the environment variables.
      ```
      export SL_USERNAME=<infrastructure_username>
      ```
      {: pre}

      ```
      export SL_API_KEY=<infrastructure_api_key>
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Verify that your environment variables are created successfully.
      ```
      printenv
      ```
      {: pre}

7.  Build and run the `mkpvyaml` container. When you run the container from the image, the `mkpvyaml.py` script is executed. The script adds a block storage device to every worker node in the cluster and authorizes each worker node to access the block storage device. At the end of the script, a `pv-<cluster_name>.yaml` YAML file is generated for you that you can later use to create the persistent volumes in the cluster.
    1.  Build the `mkpvyaml` container.
        ```
        docker build -t mkpvyaml .
        ```
        {: pre}

7. [Attach the block storage devices to your worker nodes](#attach_block).

## Classic: Manually adding block storage to specific worker nodes
{: #manual_block}

Use this option if you want to add different block storage configurations, add block storage to a subset of worker nodes only, or to have more control over the provisioning process.
{: shortdesc}

The instructions in this topic are available for classic worker nodes only. If you want to attach raw, unformatted block storage to a VPC worker node, see [Adding raw {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} to VPC worker nodes](#vpc_api_attach).
{: note}

1. List the worker nodes in your cluster and note the private IP address and the zone of the non-SDS worker nodes where you want to add a block storage device.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Review step 3 and 4 in [Deciding on your block storage configuration](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#block_predefined_storageclass) to choose the type, size, and number of IOPS for the block storage device that you want to add to your non-SDS worker node.    

3. Create the block storage device in the same zone that your non-SDS worker node is in.

   **Example for provisioning 20 GB endurance block storage with two IOPS per GB:**
   ```
   ibmcloud sl block volume-order --storage-type endurance --size 20 --tier 2 --os-type LINUX --datacenter dal10
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Example for provisioning 20 GB performance block storage with 100 IOPS:**
   ```
   ibmcloud sl block volume-order --storage-type performance --size 20 --iops 100 --os-type LINUX --datacenter dal10
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Verify that the block storage device is created and note the **`id`** of the volume. **Note:** If you do not see your block storage device right away, wait a few minutes. Then, run this command again.
   ```
   ibmcloud sl block volume-list
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   id         username          datacenter   storage_type                capacity_gb   bytes_used   ip_addr         lunId   active_transactions   
   123456789  IBM02SL1234567-8  dal10        performance_block_storage   20            -            161.12.34.123   0       0   
   ```
   {: screen}

5. Review the details for your volume and note the **`Target IP`** and **`LUN Id`**.
   ```
   ibmcloud sl block volume-detail <volume_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   Name                       Value   
   ID                         1234567890

6. Authorize the non-SDS worker node to access the block storage device. Replace `<volume_ID>` with the volume ID of your block storage device that you retrieved earlier, and `<private_worker_IP>` with the private IP address of the non-SDS worker node where you want to attach the device.

   ```
   ibmcloud sl block access-authorize <volume_ID> -p <private_worker_IP>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   The IP address 123456789 was authorized to access <volume_ID>.
   ```
   {: screen}

7. Verify that your non-SDS worker node is successfully authorized and note the **`host_iqn`**, **`username`**, and **`password`**.
   ```
   ibmcloud sl block access-list <volume_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   ID          name                 type   private_ip_address   source_subnet   host_iqn                                      username   password           allowed_host_id

   ```
   {: screen}

   The authorization is successful when the **`host_iqn`**, **`username`**, and **`password`** are assigned.

8. [Attach the block storage devices to your worker nodes](#attach_block).


## Classic: Attaching raw block storage to non-SDS worker nodes
{: #attach_block}

To attach the block storage device to a non-SDS worker node, you must create a persistent volume (PV) with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher storage class and the details of your block storage device.
{: shortdesc}

The instructions in this topic are available for classic worker nodes only. If you want to attach raw, unformatted block storage to a VPC worker node, see [Adding raw {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} to VPC worker nodes](#vpc_api_attach).
{: note}

**Before you begin**:
- Make sure that you [automatically](#automatic_block) or [manually](#manual_block) created raw, unformatted, and unmounted block storage to your non-SDS worker nodes.
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

**To attach raw block storage to non-SDS worker nodes**:
1. Prepare the PV creation.  
   - **If you used the `mkpvyaml` container:**
     1. Open the `pv-<cluster_name>.yaml` file.
        ```
        nano pv-<cluster_name>.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Review the configuration for your PVs.

   - **If you manually added block storage:**
     1. Create a `pv.yaml` file. The following command creates the file with the `nano` editor.
        ```
        nano pv.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Add the details of your block storage device to the PV.
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: PersistentVolume
        metadata:

2. Create the PV to attach the block storage device to your non-SDS worker node.
   - **If you used the `mkpvyaml` container:**
     ```
     kubectl apply -f pv-<cluster_name>.yaml
     ```
     {: pre}

   - **If you manually added block storage:**
     ```
     kubectl apply -f  block-volume-attacher/pv.yaml
     ```
     {: pre}

3. Verify that the block storage is successfully attached to your worker node.
   ```
   kubectl describe pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:

   The block storage device is successfully attached when the **ibm.io/dm** is set to a device ID, such as `/dev/dm/1`, and you can see **ibm.io/attachstatus=attached** in the **Annotations** section of your CLI output.

If you want to detach a volume, delete the PV. Detached volumes are still authorized to be accessed by a specific worker node and are attached again when you create a new PV with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Volume Attacher storage class to attach a different volume to the same worker node. To avoid attaching the old detached volume again, unauthorize the worker node to access the detached volume by using the `ibmcloud sl block access-revoke` command. Detaching the volume does not remove the volume from your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. To cancel the billing for your volume, you must manually [remove the storage from your IBM Cloud infrastructure account](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cleanup).
{: note}

## VPC: Adding raw {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} to VPC worker nodes
{: #vpc_api_attach}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} API to attach and detach raw, unformatted [{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}]((https://containers.cloud.ibm.com/swagger-storage-api/) to a worker node in your VPC cluster.
{: shortdesc}

You can attach a volume to one worker node only. Make sure that the volume is in the same zone as the worker node for the attachment to succeed.
{: note}

The instructions in this topic are available for VPC worker nodes only. If you want to attach raw, unformatted block storage to a classic worker node, you must install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage attacher plug-in](#block_storage_attacher).
{: note}

Before you begin:

[Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. Check which region and zone your VPC worker node is in.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks worker ls <cluster_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Decide on the [{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} profile](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-getting-started#determine-storage-requirements) that best meets the capacity and performance requirements that you have.

2. [Provision a {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-getting-started){: new_window}. The volume that you provision must be in the same resource group, region, and zone as the worker node.

3. Retrieve your IAM token.

  ```
  ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Retrieve the ID of the worker node that you want to attach to the {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} instance. Make sure to select a worker node that is located in the same zone as your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

6. Use a `POST` request to attach your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume to the worker node.

  Example request:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: <IAM_token>" "https://<region>.containers.cloud.ibm.com/v2/storage/vpc/createAttachment?cluster=<cluster_ID>&worker=<worker_ID>&volumeID=<volume_ID>"
  ```
  {: codeblock}


  **Understanding the create attachment `POST` request**

  | Variable | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `IAM_token` | The IAM OAuth token for your current session. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens`. |
  | `region` | The region that your cluster is in. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get <cluster_name>`. Example value: `eu-de`. |
  | `cluster_ID`. | The unique ID that is assigned to your cluster. You can retrieve this ID by running `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`. |
  | `worker_ID` | The unique ID that is assigned to the worker node where you want to attach your volume. You can retrieve this value by running `{{icks}} worker ls -c <cluster_name>`. |
  | `volume_ID` | The unique ID that is assigned to your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume. You can retrieve a list of your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volumes by running `ibmcloud is volumes`. |

7. Verify the attachment by [reviewing existing volume attachments for a VPC worker node](#vpc_api_get_worker).

8. [Create a PV and PVC by using your existing storage volume](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-block#vpc-block-static){: new_window}.


### Detaching raw and unformatted {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} from a worker node in a VPC cluster
{: #vpc_api_detach}

You can use a `DELETE` request to detach storage from a VPC worker node.
{: shortdesc}

Detaching storage from your VPC cluster does not remove your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume or the data that is stored in the volume. You continue to get billed until [you manually delete the volume](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-managing-block-storage).
{: important}

1. Identify the storage volume that you want to remove and note the volume ID.
  ```sh
  ibmcloud is volumes
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Get details about the volume. This command returns the worker node ID and attachment ID. Note the worker node ID. In the following command this ID is returned as "Instance name".
  ```sh
  ibmcloud is volume <volume_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

4. Retrieve a list of your PVs. This command returns a list of your PVs that you can then you use to determine which PVC uses the volume that you want to remove.
  ```sh
  kubectl get pv
  ```
  {: pre}

4. Describe the PV that uses the volume. If you do not know which PV uses the volume that you want to remove, you can run the `describe pv` command on each PV in your cluster. Note the PVC that uses the PV.
  ```sh
  kubectl describe pv <pv_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Check to see if your storage volume is in use by a pod. The following command shows the pods that mount the volume and the associated PVC. If no pod is returned, the storage is not in use.

  ```sh
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"
  ```
  {: pre}

6. If the pod your volume is using is part of a deployment, delete the deployment. If your pod does not belong to a deployment, delete the pod.
  ```sh
  kubectl delete deployment <deployment_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```sh
  kubectl delete pod <pod_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

7. Delete the PVC and PV.
  ```sh
  kubectl delete pvc <pvc_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```sh
  kubectl delete pv <pv_name>
  ```
  {: pre}

8. Retrieve your IAM token.
  ```sh
  ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
  ```
  {: pre}

11. Detach storage by using a `DELETE` request.

  Example request:

  ```sh
  curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: <IAM_token>" "https://<region>containers.cloud.ibm.com/v2/storage/vpc/deleteAttachment?cluster=<cluster_ID>&worker=<worker_ID>&volumeAttachmentID=<volume_attachment_ID>"
  ```
  {: codeblock}


  **Understanding the detach volume `DELETE` request**

  | Variable | Description |
  |--- | --- |
  | `IAM_token` | The IAM OAuth token for your current session. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens`. |
  | `region` | The region that your cluster is in. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get <cluster_name>`. Example value: `eu-de`. |
  | `cluster_ID`. | The unique ID that is assigned to your cluster. You can retrieve this ID by running `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`. |
  | `worker_ID` | The unique ID that is assigned to the worker node where you want to detach the volume. You can retrieve this value by running `{{icks}} worker ls -c <cluster_name>`. |
  | `volume_attachment_ID` | The unique ID that is assigned to your volume attachment. You can retrieve this ID by running `ibmcloud is volume <volume_ID>`. |

### Reviewing volume attachment details for a VPC worker node
{: #vpc_api_get_worker}

You can use a `GET` request to retrieve volume attachment details for a VPC worker node.
{: shortdesc}

1. Retrieve your IAM token.

  ```sh
  ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Retrieve the ID of the resource group where your cluster is deployed.

  ```sh
  ibmcloud ks cluster get <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep "Resource Group ID"
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Retrieve the ID of the worker node for which you want to see volume attachment details. Make sure to select a worker node that is located in the same zone as your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} instance.
  ```sh
  ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

4. Review a list of existing volume attachments on a worker node.

  Example request:

  ```sh
  curl -X GET -H "Authorization: <IAM_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Resource-Group-ID: <resource_group_ID>" "https://<region>.containers.cloud.ibm.com/v2/storage/clusters/<cluster_ID>/workers/<worker_ID>/volume_attachments"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

5. Retrieve the details for a specific attachment.
  ```sh
  curl -X GET -H "Authorization: <IAM_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Resource-Group-ID: <resource_group_ID>" "https://<region>.containers.cloud.ibm.com/v2/storage/vpc/getAttachment?cluster=<cluster_ID>&worker=<worker_ID>&volumeAttachmentID=<volume_attachment_ID>"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

**Understanding the `GET` attachment details request**

  | Variable | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `IAM_token` | The IAM OAuth token for your current session. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens`. |
  | `region` | The region that your cluster is in. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get <cluster_name>`. Example value: `eu-de`. |
  | `X-Auth-Resource-Group-ID` | The ID of the resource group that your cluster is in. You can see the ID of a resource group by running `ibmcloud resource group <resource_group_name>` or `ibmcloud ks cluster get <cluster_name>`. |
  | `<resource_group_name>` | The name of the resource group that your cluster is in. You can get a list of your resource groups by running `ibmcloud resource groups`. |
  | `cluster_ID`. | The unique ID that is assigned to your cluster. You can retrieve this ID by running `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`. |
  | `worker_ID` | The unique ID that is assigned to each of your worker nodes. You can retrieve this value by running `ibmcloud ks worker ls -c <cluster_name>`. |
  | `volume_attachment_ID` | The unique ID assigned to your volume attachment. You can retrieve this ID by running `ibmcloud is volume <volume_ID>`. |
