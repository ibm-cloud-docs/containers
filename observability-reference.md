# Observability CLI plug-in
{: #observability_cli}

The observability CLI plug-in (`ibmcloud ob`) is deprecated and support ends on 28 March 2025. There is no direct replacement, however you can now manage your observability instance and agents via the Cluster dashboard or the Cloud Logs UI.
{: deprecated}

Refer to these commands to create and manage logging and monitoring configurations for your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster.
{: shortdesc}

Looking for `ibmcloud ks` commands? See the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} CLI reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli).
{: tip}

## Logging commands
{: #logging-commands}

### `ibmcloud ob logging agent discover`
{: #logging_agent_discover}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}

Discover {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} agents that you manually installed in your cluster without using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability plug-in, and make this logging configuration visible to the plug-in so that you can use the observability plug-in commands and functions in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to manage this configuration.
{: shortdesc}

```sh
ibmcloud ob logging agent discover --cluster CLUSTER [--instance LOGGING_INSTANCE]
```
{: pre}


**Minimum required permissions**:
- **Administrator** platform access role and **Manager** service access role for all Kubernetes namespaces in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
- **Viewer** platform access role for {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}

**Command options**:
`--cluster CLUSTER`
:   The name or ID of the cluster where you manually created a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} configuration without using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability plug-in. To retrieve your cluster name or ID, run `ibmcloud ks clusters`. This value is required.

`--instance LOGGING_INSTANCE`
:   The ID or name of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance that you use in your logging configuration. This value is optional. If you don't provide this value, the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance is automatically retrieved.





### `ibmcloud ob logging config create`
{: #logging_config_create}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}

Create a logging configuration for your cluster to automatically collect pod logs and send them to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

This command deploys a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} agent as a Kubernetes daemon set in your cluster. The agent collects logs with the extension `*.log` and extensionless files that are stored in the `/var/log` directory of your pod from all namespaces, including `kube-system`. For more information, see [Forwarding cluster and app logs to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#logging). For more information about {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}, see [Securing your data](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-mng-data).   

```sh
ibmcloud ob logging config create --cluster CLUSTER --instance LOGGING_INSTANCE [--logdna-ingestion-key INGESTION_KEY] [--private-endpoint]  
```
{: pre}

**Minimum required permissions**:
- **Administrator** platform access role and **Manager** service access role for all Kubernetes namespaces in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
- **Editor** platform access role and **Manager** server access role for {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}

**Command options**:

`--cluster CLUSTER`
:   The name or ID of the cluster for which you want to create a logging configuration for {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}. To retrieve your cluster name or ID, run `ibmcloud ks clusters`. This value is required.

`--instance LOGGING_INSTANCE`
:   The ID or name of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance that you want to use to create the logging configuration. The service instance must be in the same {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account as your cluster, but can be in a different resource group or region than your cluster. To create a service instance, follow the steps in [Provision an instance](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-provision). This value is required.

`--logdna-ingestion-key INGESTION_KEY`
:   The {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} ingestion key that you want to use for your configuration. This value is optional. If you don't specify this option, the latest ingestion key is automatically retrieved.   

`--private-endpoint`
:   When you add this option to your command, the private cloud service endpoint is used to connect to {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}}. To use the private cloud service endpoint, your cluster must be enabled for using private cloud service endpoints. **1.30 and later**: If your cluster has outbound traffic protection enabled, you must specify the private endpoint option to use logging.



Example command
```sh
ibmcloud ob logging config create --cluster mycluster --instance mylogna
```
{: pre}

### `ibmcloud ob logging config delete`
{: #logging_config_delete}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}

Delete a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} configuration from your cluster.
{: shortdesc}


To remove logging configurations that you manually set up without using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} observability plug-in, you must first make this configuration available to the plug-in by using the `ibmcloud ob logging agent discover` [command](#logging_agent_discover).
{: note}

When you delete the logging configuration, the components that are deleted depend on how you created the logging configuration. For logging configurations that were created with the `ibmcloud ob logging config create` command, the daemon set for the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} agent, the ConfigMap, and secret are removed from your cluster, and pod logs are no longer sent to your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance. Logging configurations that you manually created and made visible to the plug-in by using the `ibmcloud ob logging agent discover` command, only the ConfigMap is removed. Your daemon set, secret, and the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} agent are still deployed to your cluster and you must manually remove them. Because the ConfigMap is removed, pod logs are no longer sent to your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance. Independent of how you created the configuration, existing log data is still available in {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} until your selected retention period ends.  
{: important}


```sh
ibmcloud ob logging config delete --cluster CLUSTER --instance LOGGING_INSTANCE
```
{: pre}

**Minimum required permissions**:

**Command options**:

`--cluster CLUSTER`

`--instance LOGGING_INSTANCE`
:   The ID or name of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service instance that you used in your logging configuration. To retrieve the service instance name, run `ibmcloud resource service-instances`. This value is required. 



Example command
```sh
ibmcloud ob logging config delete --cluster mycluster --instance mylogginginstance
```
{: pre}
