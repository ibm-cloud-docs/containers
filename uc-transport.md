## Shipping company increases availability of worldwide systems for business partner ecosystem
{: #uc_shipping}

An IT Exec has worldwide shipping routing and scheduling systems that partners interact with. Partners require up-to-the-minute information from these systems that access IoT device data. But, these systems were unable to scale across the globe with sufficient HA.  
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} scales containerized apps with five 9s of availability to meet growing demands. App deployments occur 40 times daily when Developers experiment easily, pushing changes to Development and Test systems quickly. The IoT Platform makes access to IoT data easy.

### Context
{: #uc_shipping_context}

Shipping company increases availability of worldwide systems for business partner ecosystem

* Regional differences for shipping logistics made it difficult to keep up with growing number of partners in multiple countries. An example is the unique regulations and transit logistics, where the company must maintain consistent records across borders.
* Just-in-time data meant that the worldwide systems must be highly available to reduce lags in transit operations. Time tables for shipping terminals are highly controlled and sometimes inflexible. Web usage is growing, so instability might cause a poor user experience.
* Developers needed to constantly evolve apps, but traditional tools slowed their ability to deploy updates and features frequently.  

### Solution
{: #uc_shipping_solution}

The shipping company needs to cohesively manage shipping time tables, inventories, and customs paperwork. Then, they can accurately share the location of shipments, shipping contents, and delivery schedules to their customers. They’re taking the guess work out of when a good (such as an appliance, clothing, or produce) arrives so that their shipping customers can communicate that information to their own customers.

The solution is made up of the following primary components.
1. Streaming data from IoT devices for each shipping container: manifests and location
2. Customs paperwork that’s digitally shared with applicable ports and transit partners, including access control
3. App for shipping customers that aggregates and communicates arrival information for shipped goods, including APIs for shipping customers to reuse shipment data in their own retail and business-to-business apps

For the shipping company to work with global partners, the routing and scheduling systems required local modifications to fit each region’s language, regulations, and unique port logistics. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} offers global coverage in multiple regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia so that the apps reflected the needs of its partners, in each country.

IoT devices stream data that {{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}} distributes to the regional port apps and associated Customs and Container manifest data stores. {{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}} is landing point for IoT events. It  distributes the events based on the managed connectivity that the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} IoT Platform offers to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}}.

After events are in {{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}}, they're persisted for immediate use in port transit apps and for any point in the future. Apps that require the lowest latency directly consume in real time from the event stream ({{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}}). Other future apps, such as analytics tools, can choose to consume in a batch mode from the event store with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}.

Since shipping data is shared with the customers of the company, the Developers ensure that the customers can use APIs to surface shipping data in their own apps. Examples of those apps are mobile tracking apps or web e-commerce solutions. The Developers are also busy with building and maintaining the regional port apps that gather and disseminate the customs records and shipping manifests. In short, they need to focus on coding instead of managing the infrastructure. Thus, they chose {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} because IBM simplifies infrastructure management.
* Managing Kubernetes master, IaaS, and operational components, such as Ingress and storage
* Monitoring health and recovery for worker nodes
* Providing global compute, so Developers aren't responsible for infrastructure in several regions where they need workloads and data to reside

To achieve global availability, the Development, Test, and Production systems were deployed across the globe in several data centers. For HA, they use a combination of multiple clusters in different geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the port app to meet business needs.
* In Frankfort clusters to comply with the local European regulations
* In the United States clusters to ensure local availability and failure recovery

They also spread the workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European version of the app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because each region uploads unique data with the port app, the app’s clusters are hosted in regions where latency is low.

For Developers, much of the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) process can be automated with {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}. The company can define workflow toolchains to prepare container images, check for vulnerabilities, and deploy them to the Kubernetes cluster.

Compute, storage, and event management that run in public cloud with access to shipment data across the globe, as needed.

Accelerated development is a key win for the HR Exec. The team gets started by containerizing their apps and putting them in the cloud. With the use of modern containers, Developers can experiment easily with Node.js SDK and push changes to Development and Test systems, which are scaled out on separate clusters. Those pushes were automated with open toolchains and {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}. No longer were updates to the HR site languishing in slow, error-prone build processes. They can deliver incremental updates to their site, daily or even more frequently. Moreover, logging and monitoring for the HR site is rapidly integrated, especially for how the site pulls personalized data from back-end benefit systems. Developers don’t waste time building complex logging systems, just to be able to troubleshoot live systems. Developers don't need to become experts in cloud security, they can enforce policy driven authentication easily by using {{site.data.keyword.appid_full_notm}}.

With {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the HR site, they could easily design Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. Another factor for less personnel costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the Developers can focus on delivering better employee experience for benefits enrollment.

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides scalable compute resources and the associated DevOps dashboards to create, scale, and tear down apps and services as needed. Using industry-standard containers technology apps can be quickly developed and shared across multiple Development, Test, and Production environments. This setup provides the immediate benefit of scalability. Using Kubernetes rich set of deployment and runtime objects, the HR team can monitor and manage upgrades to apps reliably. They can also replicate and scale the apps, by using defined rules and the automated Kubernetes orchestrator.
