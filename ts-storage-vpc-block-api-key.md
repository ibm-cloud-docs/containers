{: tsSymptoms}


Resetting your API key means the credentials the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} add-on uses to provision volumes are no longer valid. After resetting your API key, you must reset the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} controller to use the latest API key for volume provisioning.
{: tsCauses}


After resetting your API key, you must re-create the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} controller pod. To recreate the controller pod, delete it by running the following command:
{: tsResolve}

```sh
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system ibm-vpc-block-csi-controller-0
```
