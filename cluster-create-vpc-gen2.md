# Creating VPC clusters
{: #cluster-create-vpc-gen2}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} 

Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI or the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to create a standard VPC cluster, and customize your cluster to meet the high availability and security requirements of your apps.
{: shortdesc}

Do not delete the subnets that you attach to your cluster during cluster creation or when you add worker nodes in a zone. If you delete a VPC subnet that your cluster used, any load balancers that use IP addresses from the subnet might experience issues, and you might be unable to create new load balancers.
{: important}

## Prerequisites and notes
{: #cluster-create-vpc-prereq}

* If worker nodes must access public endpoints, attach a public gateway to each subnet in your VPC.

* A public network gateway is required when you want your cluster to access public endpoints, such as a public URL of another app or an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service that supports public cloud service endpoints only. Make sure to review the [VPC networking basics](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basics) to understand when a public network gateway is required and how you can set up your cluster to limit public access to one or more subnets only.
* Before you can use KMS encryption, you must create a KMS instance and set up the required service authorization in IAM. For more information, see [Managing encryption for the worker nodes in your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#worker-encryption).
* By default, your cluster is provisioned with a VPC security group and a cluster-level security group. If you want to attach additional security groups or change which default security groups are applied when you create the cluster, you must [create your VPC cluster in the CLI](#cluster_vpcg2_cli).



* If your VPC Clusters requires access to Classic Infrastructure resources, you must [enable VRF](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#vrf) and [service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui#service-endpoint) in your account.
* If you VPC Clusters doesn't require Classic Infrastructure Access, no account changes are required.



## Creating a VPC cluster in the console
{: #clusters_vpcg2_ui}
{: ui}


1. Make sure that you complete the prerequisites to [prepare your account](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters&interface=ui) and decide on your cluster setup.
1. [Navigate to the console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create?platformType=containers).
1. In the **Infrastructure** section, select **VPC**.
1. In the **Virtual private cloud** section, choose from the following options.
    * Select an existing VPC.
    * Click **Create VPC**.
1. **Optional**: If you selected **Create VPC**, complete the following steps.
    1. Select a **Geography** and **Region**. To review the available regions, see [VPC multizone regions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones-vpc)
    1. Enter a name for your VPC.
    1. Select the **Resource group** where you want to create your VPC.
    1. Enter any tags that you want to associate with your VPC.
    1. Decide whether to **Allow SSH** and **Allow ping** in the default security group.
    1. Decide whether to allow access to Classic resources.
    1. Review the subnet details. By default, subnets are spread evenly across zones. If you want to modify your subnets, uncheck the **Create subnet in every zone** box.
    1. If you modify your subnet details, specify the number of IP addresses to create. VPC subnets provide IP addresses for your worker nodes and load balancer services in the cluster, so [create a VPC subnet with enough IP addresses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_subnets). Note that you can't change the number of IPs that a VPC subnet has later. 
    1. If you enter a specific IP range, don't use the following reserved ranges: `172.16.0.0/16`, `172.18.0.0/16`, `172.19.0.0/16`, and `172.20.0.0/16`.
1. Select the cluster version.
1. Configure the **Location** details for your cluster.
    1. Select the **Resource group** that you want to create your cluster in.
        * A cluster can be created in only one resource group, and after the cluster is created, you can't change its resource group.
        * To create clusters in a resource group other than the default, you must have at least the [**Viewer** role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#checking-perms) for the resource group.
    2. Select the zones to create your cluster in. For more information about cluster availability, see [Planning your cluster for high availability](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters).
        * The zones are filtered based on the VPC that you selected, and include the VPC subnets that you previously created.
        * To create a single zone cluster, select one zone only. You can [add zones to your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#add_zone) later.
        * To create a multizone cluster, select multiple zones.
1. In the **Worker pool** section, choose your worker node flavor and number. You can add more worker pools to your cluster later. To change worker node operating systems, size, or storage, click **Change flavor**.
    * **Default**: The default flavor comes with **4 vCPUs** of computing power and **16 GB** of memory. This virtual flavor is billed hourly. Other types of flavors include the following.
    * **Bare metal**: Bare metal servers are provisioned manually by IBM Cloud infrastructure after you order, and can take more than one business day to complete. Bare metal is best suited for high-performance applications that need more resources and host control. Be sure that you want to provision a bare metal machine. Because it is billed monthly, if you cancel it immediately after an order by mistake, you are still charged the full month.
    * **Virtual - shared**: Infrastructure resources, such as the hypervisor and physical hardware, are shared across you and other IBM customers, but each worker node is accessible only by you. Although this option is usually less expensive and sufficient, you might want to verify your performance and infrastructure requirements with your company policies. Virtual machines are billed hourly.
    * **Virtual - dedicated**: Your worker nodes are hosted on infrastructure that is devoted to your account. Your physical resources are completely isolated. Virtual machines are billed hourly.
1. **Optional**: If the flavor that you want to use has a configurable secondary disk, you can modify the secondary disk by clicking the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit"). Select the storage disks that you want to add to your worker nodes and then click **Apply**. To view a list of VPC worker node flavors and their storage options, see [VPC flavors](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-flavors).
1. Set how many worker nodes to create per zone, such as **3**. You must set at least 1 worker node. For more information, see [What is the smallest size cluster that I can make?](/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs#smallest_cluster).
1. Enable [boot volume encryption](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#worker-encryption-vpc). From the drop down menus, select a key management service (KMS) instance and root key to encrypt the local disk for each worker node in the `default` worker pool. If you choose not to enable this option when you create your cluster, you can enable it later.

1. Configure your cluster with a private or a public and a private cloud service endpoint by setting the **Master service endpoint**. For more information about what setup is required to run internet-facing apps, or to keep your cluster private, see [Planning your cluster network setup](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basics#vpc-workeruser-master).

1. Configure [Secrets Manager](/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr&interface=ui) for your cluster's Ingress instance. From the **Secrets Manager instance** drop down menu, choose an existing instance that you want to register to the cluster. If no instances are available, [create one](/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr). If you want to apply a secret group, choose one from the **Secrets Manager group** drop down menu. If you choose not to enable this option when creating your cluster, you can enable it later. 


1. If you don't have the required infrastructure permissions to create a cluster, the **Infrastructure permissions checker** lists the missing permissions. Ask your account owner to [set up the API key](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access-creds) with the required permissions.
1. Complete the **Resource details** to customize the unique cluster name and any [tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag) that you want to use to organize your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, such as the team or billing department.
1. Enable any integrations that you want to include on your cluster.

    Some integrations are automatically enabled if you have an existing platform instance of that integration. In this case, you cannot disable the integration. If you want to use an integration and you have only an existing application instance of that integration, the integration is disabled by default and you must manually enable it. 
    {: note}

    - [Activity tracking]{: tag-green} Enable the [activity tracking](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started) option. From the drop down menu under **Instance**, choose an existing instance or **Create a new instance**. If you choose **Create a new instance**, the details of the new instance are shown. The new instance is created when the cluster is created. If you disable this integration and want to enable it later, see [Getting started with Activity Tracker](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started#gs_step2).
    - [Logging]{: tag-dark-teal} Enable the [logging](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-getting-started) option. From the drop down **Platform instance** menu, choose a platform instance. From the drop down **Application instance**, choose an existing application instance or choose **Create a new instance**. If you choose **Create a new instance**, the details of the new instance are shown. The new instance is created when the cluster is created. If you disable this integration and want to enable it later, see [Logging for clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health&interface=ui).
    - [Monitoring]{: tag-magenta} Enable the [monitoring](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-getting-started) option. From the drop down **Platform instance** menu, choose a platform instance. From the drop down **Application instance**, choose an existing application instance or choose **Create a new instance**. If you choose **Create a new instance**, the details of the new instance are shown. The new instance is created when the cluster is created. If you disable this integration and want to enable it later, see [Monitoring cluster health](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-monitor&interface=ui).
 


1. In the **Summary** pane, review the order summary and then click **Create**. A worker pool is created with the number of workers that you specified. You can see the progress of the worker node deployment in the **Worker nodes** tab.
    - Your cluster might take some time to provision the Kubernetes master and all worker nodes and enter a   **Normal** state. Note that even if the cluster is ready, some parts of the cluster that are used by other services, such as Ingress  secrets or registry image pull secrets, might still be in process.
    - Every worker node is assigned a unique worker node ID and domain name that must not be changed manually after the cluster is created. Changing the ID or domain name prevents the Kubernetes master from managing your cluster.
        Is your cluster not in a **Normal** state? Check out the [Debugging clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-debug_clusters) guide for help. For example, if your cluster is provisioned in an account that is protected by a firewall gateway appliance, you must [configure your firewall settings to allow outgoing traffic to the appropriate ports and IP addresses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#firewall_outbound).
        {: tip}
        
1. After your cluster is created, you can [begin working with your cluster by configuring your CLI session](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_cluster). For more possibilities, review the [Next steps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#next_steps).

## Creating VPC clusters from the CLI
{: #cluster_vpcg2_cli}
{: cli}

Create your single zone or multizone VPC cluster by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI.
{: shortdesc}

**Before you begin**:
* Make sure that you complete the prerequisites to [prepare your account](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters&interface=ui) and decide on your cluster setup.
* Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-install).
* Install the [VPC CLI plug-in](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=cli).


1. In your command line, log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and target the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region and resource group where you want to create your VPC cluster. For supported regions, see [Creating a VPC in a different region](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-in-a-different-region). Enter your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials when prompted. If you have a federated ID, use the --sso option to log in.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud login -r <region> [-g <resource_group>] [--sso]
    ```
    {: pre}

2. [Create a VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=cli#create-a-vpc-cli) in the same region where you want to create the cluster.
    Do the clusters of worker nodes in your VPC need to send and receive information to and from IBM Cloud classic infrastructure? Follow the steps in [Creating VPC subnets for classic access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#ca_subnet_cli) to create a classic-enabled VPC and VPC subnets without the automatic default address prefixes.
    {: important}
    
3. [Create a subnet for your VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=cli#create-a-subnet-cli).
    * If you want to create a [multizone cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#mz-clusters), repeat this step to create additional subnets in all the zones that you want to include in your cluster.
    * VPC subnets provide IP addresses for your worker nodes and load balancer services in the cluster, so [create a VPC subnet with enough IP addresses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_subnets), such as 256. You can't change the number of IPs that a VPC subnet has later.
    * Do not use the following reserved ranges: `172.16.0.0/16`, `172.18.0.0/16`, `172.19.0.0/16`, and `172.20.0.0/16`.
    * If worker nodes must access public endpoints, [attach a public gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=cli#attach-public-gateway-cli) to each subnet.
    * **Important**: Do not delete the subnets that you attach to your cluster during cluster creation or when you add worker nodes in a zone. If you delete a VPC subnet that your cluster used, any load balancers that use IP addresses from the subnet might experience issues, and you might be unable to create new load balancers.
    * For more information, see [Overview of VPC networking in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}: Subnets](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_subnets).

4. Create the cluster in your VPC. You can use the `ibmcloud ks cluster create vpc-gen2` command to create a single zone cluster in your VPC with worker nodes that are connected to one VPC subnet only. If you want to create a multizone cluster, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, or [add more zones](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#vpc_add_zone) to your cluster after the cluster is created. The cluster takes a few minutes to provision.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster create vpc-gen2 --name <cluster_name> --zone <vpc_zone> --vpc-id <vpc_ID> --subnet-id <vpc_subnet_ID> --flavor <worker_flavor> [--version <major.minor.patch>][--workers <number_workers_per_zone>] [--sm-group GROUP] [--sm-instance INSTANCE] [--pod-subnet] [--service-subnet] [--disable-public-service-endpoint] [[--kms-account-id <kms_account_ID>] --kms-instance <KMS_instance_ID> --crk <root_key_ID>] [--secondary-storage STORAGE]

    ```
    {: pre}

    `--name <cluster_name>`
    :   Specify a name for your cluster. The name must start with a letter, can contain letters, numbers, periods (.), and hyphen (-), and must be 35 characters or fewer. Use a name that is unique across regions. The cluster name and the region in which the cluster is deployed form the fully qualified domain name for the Ingress subdomain. To ensure that the Ingress subdomain is unique within a region, the cluster name might be truncated and appended with a random value within the Ingress domain name.

    `--zone <zone>`
    :   Specify the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} zone where you want to create your cluster. Make sure that you use a zone that matches the metro city location that you selected when you created your VPC and that you have an existing VPC subnet for that zone. For example, if you created your VPC in the Dallas metro city, your zone must be set to `us-south-1`, `us-south-2`, or `us-south-3`. To list available VPC cluster zones, run `ibmcloud ks zone ls --provider vpc-gen2`. Note that when you select a zone outside of your country, you might require legal authorization before data can be physically stored in a foreign country.

    `--vpc-id <vpc_ID>`
    :   Enter the ID of the VPC that you created earlier. To retrieve the ID of your VPC, run `ibmcloud ks vpcs`. 

    `--subnet-id <subnet_ID>`
    :   Enter the ID of the VPC subnet that you created earlier. When you create a VPC cluster from the CLI, you can initially create your cluster in one zone with one subnet only. To create a multizone cluster, [add more zones with the subnets](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers) that you created earlier to your cluster after the cluster is created. To list the IDs of your subnets in all resource groups, run ` ibmcloud ks subnets --provider vpc-gen2 --vpc-id &lt,VPC_ID> --zone <subnet_zone> `.  

    `--flavor <worker_flavor>`
    :   Enter the worker node flavor that you want to use. The flavor determines the amount of virtual CPU, memory, and disk space that is set up in each worker node and made available to your apps. VPC worker nodes can be created as virtual machines on shared infrastructure only. Bare metal or software-defined storage machines are not supported.  For more information, see [Planning your worker node setup](/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes). To view available flavors, first list available VPC zones with `ibmcloud ks zone ls --provider vpc-gen2`, and then use the zone to list supported flavors by running `ibmcloud ks flavors --zone <VPC_zone> --provider vpc-gen2`. After you create your cluster, you can add different flavors by adding a worker node or worker pool to the cluster.

    `--version <major.minor.patch>`
    :   The Kubernetes version for the cluster master node. To see available versions, run `ibmcloud ks versions`.
    
    
    `--workers <number>`
    :   Specify the number of worker nodes to include in the cluster. If you don't specify this option, a cluster with the minimum value of 1 is created. For more information, see [What is the smallest size cluster that I can make?](/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs#smallest_cluster). This value is optional.

    `--operating-system SYSTEM`
    :   Optional. The operating system of the worker nodes you want to provision in your cluster. For a list of available operating systems by cluster version, see [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} version information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
    :   If no option is specified, the default [operating system version that corresponds to the cluster version is used.


   `--cluster-security-group <group_ID>`
    :   Optional. Specify additional security group IDs to apply to all workers on the cluster. You must include a separate `--cluster-security-group` option for each individual security group you want to add. To apply the IBM-created `kube-clusterID`, use `--cluster-security-group cluster`. If no value is specified, only the `kube-clusterID` and the default VPC security group are applied. A maximum of five security groups can be applied to workers, including the default security groups. Note that the VPC security group is only applied if no other security groups are specified. For more information, see [Adding VPC security groups to clusters and worker pools during create time](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group#vpc-sg-cluster).
    
    The security groups applied to a cluster cannot be changed once the cluster is created. You can [change the rules of the security groups](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group#vpc-sg-create-rules) that are applied to the cluster, but you cannot add or remove security groups at the cluster level. If you apply the incorrect security groups at cluster create time, you must delete the cluster and create a new one. See [Adding VPC security groups to clusters and worker pools during create time](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group#vpc-sg-cluster) for more details before adding security groups to your cluster. 
    {: important}

    `--sm-group GROUP`
    :    Optional. The secret group ID of the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance where your secrets are persisted. To get a secret group ID, see the [{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} CLI reference](/docs/secrets-manager-cli-plugin?topic=secrets-manager-cli-plugin-secrets-manager-cli#secrets-manager-secret-groups-cli). Use this option to specify a [secret group](/docs/secrets-manager-cli-plugin?topic=secrets-manager-cli-plugin-secrets-manager-cli#secrets-manager-secret-groups-cli) that controls who on your team has access to cluster secrets. 

    `--sm-instance INSTANCE`
    :    Optional. The CRN of the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance. To get the CRN of an instance, run `ibmcloud ks ingress instance ls --cluster CLUSTER`. Include this option if you want to register a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to the cluster.

    `--pod-subnet`
    :   In the first cluster that you create in a VPC, the default pod subnet is `172.17.0.0/18`. In the second cluster that you create in that VPC, the default pod subnet is `172.17.64.0/18`. In each subsequent cluster, the pod subnet range is the next available, non-overlapping `/18` subnet. If you plan to connect your cluster to on-premises networks through {{site.data.keyword.BluDirectLink}} or a VPN service, you can avoid subnet conflicts by specifying a custom subnet CIDR that provides the private IP addresses for your pods.
    When you choose a subnet size, consider the size of the cluster that you plan to create and the number of worker nodes that you might add in the future. The subnet must have a CIDR of at least `/23`, which provides enough pod IP addresses for a maximum of four worker nodes in a cluster. For larger clusters, use `/22` to have enough pod IP addresses for eight worker nodes, `/21` to have enough pod IP addresses for 16 worker nodes, and so on. Note that the pod and service subnets can't overlap. If you use custom-range subnets for your worker nodes, [you must ensure that your worker node subnets don't overlap with your cluster's pod subnet](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc-ip-range). The subnet that you choose must be within one of the following ranges:
        - `172.17.0.0 - 172.17.255.255`
        - `172.21.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
        - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.254.255`
        - `198.18.0.0 - 198.19.255.255`

    `--service-subnet`
    :   All services that are deployed to the cluster are assigned a private IP address in the 172.21.0.0/16 range by default. If you plan to connect your cluster to on-premises networks through {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} or a VPN service, you can avoid subnet conflicts by specifying a custom subnet CIDR that provides the private IP addresses for your services.
    The subnet must be specified in CIDR format with a size of at least `/24`, which allows a maximum of 255 services in the cluster, or larger. The subnet that you choose must be within one of the following ranges:
    - `172.17.0.0 - 172.17.255.255`
    - `172.21.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
    - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.254.255`
    - `198.18.0.0 - 198.19.255.255` Note that the pod and service subnets can't overlap.

    `--disable-public-service-endpoint`
    :   Include this option in your command to create your VPC cluster with a private cloud service endpoint only. If you don't include this option, your cluster is set up with a public and a private cloud service endpoint. The service endpoint determines how your Kubernetes master and the worker nodes communicate, how your cluster access other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services and apps outside the cluster, and how your users connect to your cluster. For more information, see [Planning your cluster network setup](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_vpc_basics).
        

    `--kms-account-id <KMS_acount_ID>`
    :   Optional: Must be included if the `--kms-instance-id` and `--crk` options are provided and the KMS instance resides in an account different from the cluster's account, otherwise it can be omitted.
        Setting up encryption by using a KMS from a different account is available for allowlisted accounts only. To get added to the allowlist, [open a case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/form){: external} with support.
        {: note}


    `--kms-instance <KMS_instance_ID>`
    :   Optional: Include the ID of a key management service (KMS) instance to use to encrypt the local disk on the worker nodes in the `default` worker pool. To list available KMS instances, run `ibmcloud ks kms instance ls`. If you include this option, you must also include the `--crk` option.
        Before you can use KMS encryption, you must create a KMS instance and set up the required service authorization in IAM. See [Managing encryption](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#worker-encryption) for the worker nodes in your cluster.
        {: note}
  

    `--crk <root_key>`
    :   Optional: Include the ID of the root key in the KMS instance to use to encrypt the local disk on the worker nodes in the `default` worker pool. To list available root keys, run `ibmcloud ks kms crk ls --instance-id`. If you include this option, you must also include the `--kms-instance` option.
        Before you can use KMS encryption, you must create a KMS instance and set up the required service authorization in IAM. See [Managing encryption](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#worker-encryption) for the worker nodes in your cluster.
        {: note}

    `--secondary-storage STORAGE`
    :    Optional. The storage option for the flavor. For example, `900gb.5iops-tier`. When you add a secondary disk, that disk is used for the container runtime, while the primary disk is used for the operating system. To view the storage options for a flavor, run the `**ibmcloud ks flavor get --flavor FLAVOR --zone ZONE --provider vpc-gen2` command. To view a list of VPC worker node flavors, see [VPC flavors](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-flavors&interface=ui)
    
5. Verify that the creation of the cluster was requested. It can take a few minutes for the worker node machines to be ordered, and for the cluster to be set up and provisioned in your account.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster ls
    ```
    {: pre}

    When the provisioning of your Kubernetes master is completed, the state of your cluster changes to **normal**. After the Kubernetes master is ready, your worker nodes are set up.
    ```sh
    NAME         ID                                   State      Created          Workers    Zone      Version     Resource Group Name   Provider
    mycluster    aaf97a8843a29941b49a598f516da72101   normal   20170201162433   3          Dallas     1.26.7_1526      Default               vpc-gen2
    ```
    {: screen}

    Is your cluster not in a **normal** state? Check out the [Debugging clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-debug_clusters) guide for help. For example, if your cluster is provisioned in an account that is protected by a firewall gateway appliance, you must [configure your firewall settings to allow outgoing traffic to the appropriate ports and IP addresses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#firewall_outbound).
    {: tip}

6. Check the status of the worker nodes.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    When the worker nodes are ready, the worker node **State** changes to `normal` and the **Status** changes to `Ready`. When the node **Status** changes to `Ready`, you can access the cluster. Note that even if the cluster is ready, some parts of the cluster that are used by other services, such as Ingress secrets or registry image pull secrets, might still be in process.
    ```sh
    ID                                                     Public IP        Private IP     Flavor              State    Status   Zone    Version
    kube-blrs3b1d0p0p2f7haq0g-mycluster-default-000001f7   169.xx.xxx.xxx  10.xxx.xx.xxx   b3c.4x16.encrypted  normal   Ready    dal10   1.26.7_1526
    ```
    {: screen}

    Every worker node is assigned a unique worker node ID and domain name that must not be changed manually after the cluster is created. If you change the ID or domain name, the Kubernetes master cannot manage your cluster.
    {: important}

Your cluster is ready for your workloads! You might also want to [add a tag to your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#cluster_tags), such as the team or billing department that uses the cluster, to help manage {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. For more ideas of what to do with your cluster, review the [Next steps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#next_steps). 


## Example commands to create VPC clusters
{: #cluster_create_vpc}
{: cli}

VPC Gen 2 cluster flavors with instance storage are available for allowlisted accounts. To get added to the allowlist, [open a case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/form){: external} with support.
{: note}

```sh
ibmcloud ks cluster create vpc-gen2 --name my_cluster --zone us-east-1 --vpc-id <VPC_ID> --subnet-id <VPC_SUBNET_ID> --flavor bx2.4x16 --workers 3
```
{: pre}

For a VPC multizone cluster, after you created the cluster in a [multizone metro](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones-vpc), [add zones](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#vpc_add_zone).

```sh
ibmcloud ks zone add vpc-gen2 --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <pool_name> --subnet-id <VPC_SUBNET_ID>
```

## Creating a VPC cluster with Terraform
{: #cluster_vpcg2_tf}
{: terraform}


Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform infrastructure and resources, including VPC clusters. To create a VPC cluster with Terraform, you first create a Terraform configuration file that declares the type of cluster resource you want to create. Then, you apply the Terraform configuration file. For more information on Terraform, see [About Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-about).

**Before you begin:**
* [Install the Terraform CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-setup_cli#tf_installation).
* Make sure you have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key). 

1. Create a Terraform provider file. Save the file in your Terraform directory. For more information, see the [Terraform IBM Cloud Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs){: external}. 

    Example Terraform provider file. 

    ```sh
    terraform {
    required_providers {
        ibm = {
        source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
        version = "1.53.0"
        }
    }
    }

    provider "ibm" {
    region = "us-south"
    ibmcloud_api_key = "<api-key>"
    }
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Create a Terraform configuration file for a VPC cluster. Save the file in your Terraform directory. For more information and cluster configuration options, see the [Terraform `ibm_container_cluster`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs){: external} documentation. 

    Example Terraform configuration file. 
    ```sh
    resource "ibm_container_vpc_cluster" "cluster" {
    name              = "tf-vpc"
    vpc_id            = "<vpc_id>"
    flavor            = "bx2.16x64"
    worker_count      = "3"
    resource_group_id = "<resource_group_id>"
    zones {
        subnet_id = "<subnet_id>"
        name      = "us-south-1"
        }
    }
    ```
    {: pre}

    `name`
    :   Required. The name of the cluster.

    `vpc_id`
    :   Required. The ID of the VPC that you want to use for your cluster. To list available VPCs, run `ibmcloud is vpcs`.

    `flavor`
    :   Required. The worker node flavor. The flavor determines the amount of memory, CPU, and disk space that is available to your worker nodes. For a list of available worker node flavors, run `ibmcloud ks flavors --zone <zone> --provider classic`, or see [Classic flavors](/docs/containers?topic=containers-classic-flavors&interface=ui).

    `worker_count`
    :   The number of worker nodes that you want to add to the default worker pool. 
    
    `resource_group_id`
    :   The ID of the resource group. To see available resource groups, run `ibmcloud resource groups`. If no value is provided, the default resource group is used.

    `zones`
    :   A nested block that describes the zones of the VPC cluster's default worker pool.
    :   - `subnet_id`: Required. The ID of the VPC subnet that you want to use for your worker nodes. To find existing subnets, run `ibmcloud ks subnets --provider classic --zone <zone>`.
    :   - `name`: Required. The zone name for the default worker pool. To see available zones, run `ibmcloud ks zones --provider vpc-gen2`.



3. In the CLI, navigate to your Terraform directory.
    ```sh
    cd <terraform_directory>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Run the commands to initialize and plan your Terraform actions. Review the plan output to make sure the correct actions are performed. 

    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    terraform plan
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Apply the Terraform files to create the cluster. Then, navigate to the IBM Cloud console to check that the cluster is provisioning.
    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    
    
## Next steps for VPC clusters
{: #cluster-create-vpc-next-steps}


* Expose your apps with [public networking services](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#public_access) or [private networking services](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#private_access).
* Connect your cluster with services in private networks outside of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account or with resources in other VPCs by [setting up the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} VPN](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-vpnaas).
* [Add rules to the security group for your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy) to control ingress and egress traffic to your VPC subnets.
