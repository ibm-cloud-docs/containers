# Setting up the CLI and API
{: #cs_cli_install}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} CLI or API to create and manage your Kubernetes clusters.
{:shortdesc}

<br />


## Installing the CLI
{: #cs_cli_install_steps}

Install the required CLIs to create and manage your Kubernetes clusters in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, and to deploy containerized apps to your cluster.
{:shortdesc}

This task includes the information for installing these CLIs and plug-ins:

-   {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI version 0.8.0 or later
-   {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in
-   Kubernetes CLI version that matches the `major.minor` version of your cluster
-   Optional: {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} plug-in

<br>
To install the CLIs:

1.  As a prerequisite for the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in, install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](../cli/index.html#overview). The prefix for running commands by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI is `ibmcloud`.

    Plan to use the CLI a lot? Try [Enabling shell autocompletion for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI (Linux/MacOS only)](/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/enable_cli_autocompletion.html#enabling-shell-autocompletion-for-ibm-cloud-cli-linux-macos-only-).
    {: tip}

2.  Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} credentials when prompted.

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
    {: tip}

3.  To create Kubernetes clusters and manage worker nodes, install the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in. The prefix for running commands by using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in is `ibmcloud ks`.

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin install container-service 
    ```
    {: pre}

    To verify that the plug-in is installed properly, run the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin list
    ```
    {: pre}

    The {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in is displayed in the results as container-service.

4.  {: #kubectl}To view a local version of the Kubernetes dashboard and to deploy apps into your clusters, [install the Kubernetes CLI ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). The prefix for running commands by using the Kubernetes CLI is `kubectl`.

    1.  Download the Kubernetes CLI `major.minor` version that matches the Kubernetes cluster `major.minor` version that you plan to use. The current {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} default Kubernetes version is 1.10.8.

        If you use a `kubectl` CLI version that does not match at least the `major.minor` version of your clusters, you might experience unexpected results. Make sure to keep your Kubernetes cluster and CLI versions up-to-date.
        {: note}

        - **OS X**:   [https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.8/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.8/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl)
        - **Linux**:   [https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.8/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.8/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl)
        - **Windows**:    [https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.8/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.10.8/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe)

    2.  **For OSX and Linux**: Complete the following steps.
        1.  Move the executable file to the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

            ```
            mv /filepath/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
            ```
            {: pre}

        2.  Make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is listed in your `PATH` system variable. The `PATH` variable contains all directories where your operating system can find executable files. The directories that are listed in the `PATH` variable serve different purposes. `/usr/local/bin` is used to store executable files for software that is not part of the operating system and that was manually installed by the system administrator.

            ```
            echo $PATH
            ```
            {: pre}

            Example CLI output:

            ```
            /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
            ```
            {: screen}

        3.  Make the file executable.

            ```
            chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl
            ```
            {: pre}

    3.  **For Windows**: Install the Kubernetes CLI in the same directory as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. This setup saves you some filepath changes when you run commands later.

5.  To manage a private image repository, install the {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} plug-in. Use this plug-in to set up your own namespace in a multi-tenant, highly available, and scalable private image registry that is hosted by IBM, and to store and share Docker images with other users. Docker images are required to deploy containers into a cluster. The prefix for running registry commands is `ibmcloud cr`.

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin install container-registry 
    ```
    {: pre}

    To verify that the plug-in is installed properly, run the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin list
    ```
    {: pre}

    The plug-in is displayed in the results as container-registry.

Next, start [Creating Kubernetes clusters from the CLI with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](cs_clusters.html#clusters_cli).

For reference information about these CLIs, see the documentation for those tools.

-   [`ibmcloud` commands](../cli/reference/ibmcloud/bx_cli.html#ibmcloud_cli)
-   [`ibmcloud ks` commands](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_cli_reference)
-   [`kubectl` commands ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
-   [`ibmcloud cr` commands](/docs/cli/plugins/registry/index.html)

<br />




## Running the CLI in a container on your computer
{: #cs_cli_container}

Instead of installing each of the CLIs individually on your computer, you can install the CLIs into a container that runs on your computer.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, [install Docker ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) to build and run images locally. If you are using Windows 8 or earlier, you can install the [Docker Toolbox ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) instead.

1. Create an image from the provided Dockerfile.

    ```
    docker build -t <image_name> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/install-clis-container/Dockerfile
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Deploy the image locally as a container and mount a volume to access local files.

    ```
    docker run -it -v /local/path:/container/volume <image_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Begin running `ibmcloud ks` and `kubectl` commands from the interactive shell. If you create data that you want to save, save that data to the volume that you mounted. When you exit the shell, the container stops.

<br />



## Configuring the CLI to run `kubectl`
{: #cs_cli_configure}

You can use the commands that are provided with the Kubernetes CLI to manage clusters in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

All `kubectl` commands that are available in Kubernetes 1.10.8 are supported for use with clusters in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. After you create a cluster, set the context for your local CLI to that cluster with an environment variable. Then, you can run the Kubernetes `kubectl` commands to work with your cluster in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Before you can run `kubectl` commands:
* [Install the required CLIs](#cs_cli_install).
* [Create a cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_cli).

To use `kubectl` commands:

1.  Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} credentials when prompted. To specify an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region, [include the API endpoint](cs_regions.html#bluemix_regions).

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
    {: tip}

2.  Select an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. If you are assigned to multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organizations, select the organization where the cluster was created. Clusters are specific to an organization, but are independent from an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} space. Therefore, you are not required to select a space.

3.  To create and work with clusters in a resource group other than the default, target that resource group. To see the resource group that each cluster belongs to, run `ibmcloud ks clusters`. **Note**: You must have [**Viewer** access](cs_users.html#platform) to the resource group.
    ```
    ibmcloud target -g <resource_group_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  To create or access Kubernetes clusters in a region other than the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region that you selected earlier, target the region.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks region-set
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  List all of the clusters in the account to get the name of the cluster.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks clusters
    ```
    {: pre}

6.  Set the cluster you created as the context for this session. Complete these configuration steps every time that you work with your cluster.
    1.  Get the command to set the environment variable and download the Kubernetes configuration files.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        After downloading the configuration files, a command is displayed that you can use to set the path to the local Kubernetes configuration file as an environment variable.

        Example:

        ```
        export KUBECONFIG=/Users/<user_name>/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/mycluster/kube-config-prod-dal10-mycluster.yml
        ```
        {: screen}

    2.  Copy and paste the command that is displayed in your terminal to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

        **Mac or Linux user**: Instead of running the `ibmcloud ks cluster-config` command and copying the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, you can run `(ibmcloud ks cluster-config "<cluster-name>" | grep export)`.
        {:tip}

    3.  Verify that the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set properly.

        Example:

        ```
        echo $KUBECONFIG
        ```
        {: pre}

        Output:
        ```
        /Users/<user_name>/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/mycluster/kube-config-prod-dal10-mycluster.yml
        ```
        {: screen}

7.  Verify that the `kubectl` commands run properly with your cluster by checking the Kubernetes CLI server version.

    ```
    kubectl version  --short
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Client Version: v1.10.8
    Server Version: v1.10.8
    ```
    {: screen}

Now, you can run `kubectl` commands to manage your clusters in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. For a full list of commands, see the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).

**Tip:** If you are using Windows and the Kubernetes CLI is not installed in the same directory as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI, you must change directories to the path where the Kubernetes CLI is installed to run `kubectl` commands successfully.


<br />


## Updating the CLI
{: #cs_cli_upgrade}

You might want to update the CLIs periodically to use new features.
{:shortdesc}

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```
    {: pre}

     If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
     {: tip}

3.  Update the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in.
    1.  Install the update from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} plug-in repository.

        {: pre}

    2.  Verify the plug-in installation by running the following command and checking the list of the plug-ins that are installed.

        ```
        ibmcloud plugin list
        ```
        {: pre}

        The registry plug-in is displayed in the results as container-registry.

<br />


## Uninstalling the CLI
{: #cs_cli_uninstall}

If you no longer need the CLI, you can uninstall it.
{:shortdesc}

This task includes the information for removing these CLIs:


-   {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in

<br />


## Automating cluster deployments with the API
{: #cs_api}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API to automate the creation, deployment, and management of your Kubernetes clusters.
{:shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API requires header information that you must provide in your API request and that can vary depending on the API that you want to use. To determine what header information is needed for your API, see the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://us-south.containers.bluemix.net/swagger-api).

To authenticate with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, you must provide an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) token that is generated with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} credentials and that includes the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account ID where the cluster was created. Depending on the way you authenticate with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can choose between the following options to automate the creation of your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM token.

You can also use the [API swagger JSON file ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://containers.bluemix.net/swagger-api-json) to generate a client that can interact with the API as part of your automation work.

## Refreshing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM access tokens and obtaining new refresh tokens with the API
{: #cs_api_refresh}

Every {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) access token that is issued via the API expires after one hour. You must refresh your access token on a regular basis to assure access to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API. You can use the same steps to obtain a new refresh token.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, make sure that you have an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM refresh token or an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API key that you can use to request a new access token.
- **Refresh token:** Follow the instructions in [Automating the cluster creation and management process with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API](#cs_api).
- **API key:** Retrieve your [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/) API key as follows.
   1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** > **Security** > **Platform API keys**.
   2. Click **Create**.
   3. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for your API key and click **Create**.
   4. Click **Show** to see the API key that was generated for you.
   5. Copy the API key so that you can use it to retrieve your new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM access token.

Use the following steps if you want to create an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM token or if you want to obtain a new refresh token.

1.  Generate a new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM access token by using the refresh token or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API key.
    ```
    POST https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    <table summary="Input parameters for new IAM token">

    <tr>
    <td>Header</td>
    <td><ul><li>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li>
      <li>Authorization: Basic Yng6Yng=</br></br><strong>Note:</strong> <code>Yng6Yng=</code> equals the URL-encoded authorization for the username <strong>bx</strong> and the password <strong>bx</strong>.</li></ul></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Body when using the refresh token</td>
    <td><ul><li>grant_type: refresh_token</li>
    <li>response_type: cloud_iam uaa</li>
    <li>refresh_token: <em>&lt;iam_refresh_token&gt;</em></li>
    <li>uaa_client_ID: cf</li>
    <li>uaa_client_secret:</li>
    <li>bss_account: <em>&lt;account_ID&gt;</em></li></ul><strong>Note</strong>: Add the <code>uaa_client_secret</code> key with no value specified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Body when using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API key</td>
      <td><ul><li>grant_type: <code>urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey</code></li>
    <li>response_type: cloud_iam uaa</li>
    <li>apikey: <em>&lt;api_key&gt;</em></li>
    <li>uaa_client_ID: cf</li>
        <li>uaa_client_secret:</li></ul><strong>Note:</strong> Add the <code>uaa_client_secret</code> key with no value specified.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    Example API output:

    ```
    {
      "access_token": "<iam_token>",
      "refresh_token": "<iam_refresh_token>",
      "uaa_token": "<uaa_token>",
      "uaa_refresh_token": "<uaa_refresh_token>",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "expiration": 1493747503
    }

    ```
    {: screen}

    You can find your new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM token in the **access_token**, and the refresh token in the **refresh_token** field of your API output.

2.  Continue working with the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://containers.bluemix.net/swagger-api) by using the token from the previous step.

## Refreshing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM access tokens and obtaining new refresh tokens with the CLI
{: #cs_cli_refresh}

When you start a new CLI session, or if 24 hours has expired in your current CLI session, you must set the context for your cluster by running `ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name>`. When you set the context for your cluster with this command, the `kubeconfig` file for your Kubernetes cluster is downloaded. Additionally, an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) ID token and a refresh token are issued to provide authentication.
{: shortdesc}

**ID token**: Every IAM ID token that is issued via the CLI expires after one hour. When the ID token expires, the refresh token is sent to the token provider to refresh the ID token. Your authentication is refreshed, and you can continue to run commands against your cluster.

**Refresh token**: Refresh tokens expire every 30 days. If the refresh token is expired, the ID token cannot be refreshed, and you are not able to continue running commands in the CLI. You can get a new refresh token by running `ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name>`. This command also refreshes your ID token.
