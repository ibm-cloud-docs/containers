# Updating clusters, worker nodes, and add-ons
{: #update}

You can install updates to keep your Kubernetes clusters up-to-date in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Updating the Kubernetes master
{: #master}

Periodically, Kubernetes releases [major, minor, or patch updates](cs_versions.html#version_types). Updates can affect the Kubernetes API server version or other components in your Kubernetes master. IBM updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions.
{:shortdesc}

**How do I know when to update the master?**</br>
You are notified in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console and CLI when updates are available, and can also check our [supported versions](cs_versions.html) page.

**How many versions behind the latest can the master be?**</br>
IBM generally supports 3 versions of Kubernetes at a given time. You can update the Kubernetes API server no more than 2 versions ahead of its current version.

For example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.7 and you want to update to 1.10, you must first update to 1.9. You can force the update to occur, but updating three or more minor versions might cause unexpected results or failure.

If your cluster is running an unsupported Kubernetes version, you might have to force the update. Therefore, keep your cluster up to date to avoid operational impact.

**Can my worker nodes run a later version than the master?**</br>
No. First, [update your master](#update_master) to the latest Kubernetes version. Then, [update the worker nodes](#worker_node) in your cluster.

**How are patch updates applied?**</br>
By default, patch updates for the master are applied automatically over the course of several days, so a master patch version might show up as available before it is applied to your master. The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another. In any of these cases, you can [check the versions changelog](cs_versions_changelog.html) for any potential impact and choose to safely use the `ibmcloud ks cluster-update` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.

Unlike the master, you must update your workers for each patch version.

**What happens during the master update?**</br>
In clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.11 or later, your master is highly available with three replica master pods. The master pods have a rolling update, during which only one pod is unavailable at a time. Two instances are up and running so that you can access and change the cluster during the update. Your worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.

For clusters that run previous versions of Kubernetes, when you update the Kubernetes API server, the API server is down for about 5 - 10 minutes. During the update, you cannot access or change the cluster. However, worker nodes, apps, and resources that cluster users have deployed are not modified and continue to run.

**Can I roll back the update?**</br>
No, you cannot roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place. Be sure to use a test cluster and follow the instructions to address potential issues before updating your production master.

**What process can I follow to update the master?**</br>
The following diagram shows the process that you can take to update your master.

![Master update best practice](/images/update-tree.png)

Figure 1. Updating Kubernetes master process diagram

{: #update_master}
Before you begin, make sure you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM platform role](cs_users.html#platform).

To update the Kubernetes master _major_ or _minor_ version:

1.  Review the [Kubernetes changes](cs_versions.html) and make any updates marked _Update before master_.

2.  Update your Kubernetes API server and associated Kubernetes master components by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console or running the CLI `ibmcloud ks cluster-update` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_cluster_update).

3.  Wait a few minutes, then confirm that the update is complete. Review the Kubernetes API server version on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard or run `ibmcloud ks clusters`.

4.  Install the version of the [`kubectl cli`](cs_cli_install.html#kubectl) that matches the Kubernetes API server version that runs in the Kubernetes master.

When the Kubernetes API server update is complete, you can update your worker nodes.

<br />


## Updating worker nodes
{: #worker_node}

You received a notification to update your worker nodes. What does that mean? As security updates and patches are put in place for the Kubernetes API server and other Kubernetes master components, you must be sure that the worker nodes remain in sync.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- [Log in to your account. Target the appropriate region and, if applicable, resource group. Set the context for your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).
- [Update the Kubernetes master](#master). The worker node Kubernetes version cannot be higher than the Kubernetes API server version that runs in your Kubernetes master.
- Make any changes that are marked with _Update after master_ in the [Kubernetes changes](cs_versions.html).
- If you want to apply a patch update, review the [Kubernetes version changelog](cs_versions_changelog.html#changelog).
- Make sure you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM platform role](cs_users.html#platform). </br>

**Attention**: Updates to worker nodes can cause downtime for your apps and services. Data is deleted if not [stored outside the pod](cs_storage_planning.html#persistent_storage_overview).


**What happens to my apps during an update?**</br>
If you run apps as part of a deployment on worker nodes that you update, the apps are rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster. These worker nodes might be in a different worker pool, or if you have stand-alone worker nodes, apps might be scheduled onto stand-alone worker nodes. To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload.

**How can I control how many worker nodes go down at a given time during the update?**
If you need all your worker nodes to be up and running, consider [resizing your worker pool](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_pool_resize) or [adding stand-alone worker nodes](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_add) to add more worker nodes. You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.

In addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time during the update. Worker nodes are identified by the worker node labels. You can use IBM-provided labels or custom labels that you added to the worker node.

**What if I choose not to define a config map?**</br>
When the config map is not defined, the default is used. By default, a maximum of 20% of all of your worker nodes in each cluster can be unavailable during the update process.

To create a config map and update worker nodes:

1.  List available worker nodes and note their private IP address.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. View the labels of a worker node. You can find the worker node labels in the **Labels** section of your CLI output. Every label consists of a `NodeSelectorKey` and a `NodeSelectorValue`.
   ```
   kubectl describe node <private_worker_IP>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   Name:               10.184.58.3
   Roles:              <none>
   Labels:             arch=amd64
                    beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64

   Taints:             <none>
   Unschedulable:      false
   ```
   {: screen}

3. Create a config map and define the unavailability rules for your worker nodes. The following example shows 4 checks, the `zonecheck.json`, `regioncheck.json`, `defaultcheck.json`, and a check template. You can use these example checks to define rules for worker nodes in a specific zone (`zonecheck.json`), region (`regioncheck.json`), or for all worker nodes that do not match any of the checks that you defined in the config map (`defaultcheck.json`). Use the check template to create your own check. For every check, to identify a worker node, you must choose one of the worker node labels that you retrieved in the previous step.  

   **Note:** For every check, you can set only one value for <code>NodeSelectorKey</code> and <code>NodeSelectorValue</code>. If you want to set rules for more than one region, zone, or other worker node labels, create a new check. Define up to 10 checks in a config map. If you add more checks, they are ignored.

   Example:
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cluster-update-configuration
     namespace: kube-system
   data:
    drain_timeout_seconds: "120"
    zonecheck.json: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": 30,
        "NodeSelectorKey": "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone",
        "NodeSelectorValue": "dal13"
      }
    regioncheck.json: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": 20,
        "NodeSelectorKey": "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region",
        "NodeSelectorValue": "us-south"
      }
    defaultcheck.json: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": 20
      }
    <check_name>: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": <value_in_percentage>,
        "NodeSelectorKey": "<node_selector_key>",
        "NodeSelectorValue": "<node_selector_value>"
      }
   ```
   {:pre}

   </table>

4. Create the configuration map in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f <filepath/configmap.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Verify that the config map is created.
   ```
   kubectl get configmap --namespace kube-system
   ```
   {: pre}

6.  Update the worker nodes.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker-update <cluster_name_or_ID> <worker_node1_ID> <worker_node2_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

7. Optional: Verify the events that are triggered by the config map and any validation errors that occur. The events can be reviewed in the  **Events** section of your CLI output.
   ```
   kubectl describe -n kube-system cm ibm-cluster-update-configuration
   ```
   {: pre}

8. Confirm that the update is complete by reviewing the Kubernetes version of your worker nodes.  
   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
   {: pre}

9. Verify that you do not have duplicate worker nodes. In some cases, older clusters might list duplicate worker nodes with a **NotReady** status after an update. To remove duplicates, see [troubleshooting](cs_troubleshoot_clusters.html#cs_duplicate_nodes).

Next steps:
  - Repeat the update process with other worker pools.
  - Inform developers who work in the cluster to update their `kubectl` CLI to the version of the Kubernetes master.
  - If the Kubernetes dashboard does not display utilization graphs, [delete the `kube-dashboard` pod](cs_troubleshoot_health.html#cs_dashboard_graphs).

<br />



## Updating machine types
{: #machine_type}

You can update the machine types of your worker nodes by adding new worker nodes and removing the old ones. For example, if you have virtual worker nodes on deprecated machine types with `u1c` or `b1c` in the names, create worker nodes that use machine types with `u2c` or `b2c` in the names.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- [Log in to your account. Target the appropriate region and, if applicable, resource group. Set the context for your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).
- If you store data on your worker node, the data is deleted if not [stored outside the worker node](cs_storage_planning.html#persistent_storage_overview).
- Make sure you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM platform role](cs_users.html#platform).


**Attention**: Updates to worker nodes can cause downtime for your apps and services. Data is deleted if not [stored outside the pod](cs_storage_planning.html#persistent_storage_overview).

1. List available worker nodes and note their private IP address.
   - **For worker nodes in a worker pool**:
     1. List available worker pools in your cluster.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pools --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. List the worker nodes in the worker pool.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <pool_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

     3. Get the details for a worker node and note the zone, the private and the public VLAN ID.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-get <cluster_name_or_ID> <worker_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

   - **Deprecated: For stand-alone worker nodes**:
     1. List available worker nodes.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Get the details for a worker node and note the zone, the private and the public VLAN ID.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-get <cluster_name_or_ID> <worker_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

2. List available machine types in the zone.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks machine-types <zone>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Create a worker node with the new machine type.
   - **For worker nodes in a worker pool**:
     1. Create a worker pool with the number of worker nodes that you want to replace.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool-create --name <pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --machine-type <machine_type> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Verify that the worker pool is created.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pools --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     3. Add the zone to your worker pool that you retrieved earlier. When you add a zone, the worker nodes that are defined in your worker pool are provisioned in the zone and considered for future workload scheduling. If you want to spread your worker nodes across multiple zones, choose a [multizone-capable zone](cs_regions.html#zones).
        ```
        ibmcloud ks zone-add --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pools <pool_name> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

   - **Deprecated: For stand-alone worker nodes**:
       ```
       ibmcloud ks worker-add --cluster <cluster_name> --machine-type <machine_type> --number <number_of_worker_nodes> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
       ```
       {: pre}

4. Wait for the worker nodes to be deployed.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   When the worker node state changes to **Normal**, the deployment is finished.

5. Remove the old worker node. **Note**: If you are removing a machine type that is billed monthly (such as bare metal), you are charged for the entire the month.
   - **For worker nodes in a worker pool**:
     1. Remove the worker pool with the old machine type. Removing a worker pool removes all worker nodes in the pool in all zones. This process might take a few minutes to complete.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool-rm --worker-pool <pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Verify that the worker pool is removed.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pools --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

   - **Deprecated: For stand-alone worker nodes**:
      ```
      ibmcloud ks worker-rm <cluster_name> <worker_node>
      ```
      {: pre}

6. Verify that the worker nodes are removed from your cluster.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

7. Repeat these steps to update other worker pools or stand-alone worker nodes to different machine types.

## Updating cluster add-ons
{: #addons}

Your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster comes with add-ons, such as Fluentd for logging, that are installed automatically when you provision the cluster. By default, these add-ons are updated automatically by IBM. However, you can disable automatic updates for some add-ons and manually update them separately from the master and worker nodes.
{: shortdesc}

**What default add-ons can I update separately from the cluster?**</br>
You can optionally disable automatic updates for the following add-ons:
* [Fluentd for logging](#logging)
* [Ingress application load balancer](#alb)

**Are there add-ons that I can't update separately from the cluster?**</br>

Yes. Your cluster is deployed with the following managed add-ons and associated resources that cannot be changed. If you try to change one of these deployment add-ons, their original settings are restored on a regular interval.

* `heapster`
* `ibm-file-plugin`
* `ibm-storage-watcher`
* `ibm-keepalived-watcher`
* `kube-dns-amd64`
* `kube-dns-autoscaler`
* `kubernetes-dashboard`
* `vpn`

You can view these resources by using the `addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile` label. For example:

```
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces -l addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode=Reconcile
```
{: pre}

**Can I install other add-ons than the default?**</br>
Yes. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides other add-ons that you can choose from to add capabilities to your cluster. For example, you might want to [use Helm charts](cs_integrations.html#helm) to install the [block storage plug-in](cs_storage_block.html#install_block), [Istio](cs_tutorials_istio.html#istio_tutorial), or [strongSwan VPN](cs_vpn.html#vpn-setup). You must update each add-on separately by following the instructions to update the Helm charts.

### Disabling automatic updates for the Fluentd for logging add-on and manually updating Fluentd pods
{: #logging}

In order to make changes to your logging or filter configurations, the Fluentd add-on must be at the latest version. By default, automatic updates to the add-on are enabled.
{: shortdesc}

You can check whether automatic updates are enabled by running the `ibmcloud ks logging-autoupdate-get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_log_autoupdate_get).

To disable automatic updates, run the `ibmcloud ks logging-autoupdate-disable` [command](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_log_autoupdate_disable).

If automatic updates are disabled but you need to make a change to your configuration, you have two options.

*  Turn on automatic updates for your Fluentd pods.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-autoupdate-enable --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

*  Force a one-time update when you use a logging command that includes the `--force-update` option. **Note**: Your pods update to the latest version of the Fluentd add-on, but Fluentd does not update automatically going forward.

    Example command:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-update --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --id <log_config_ID> --type <log_type> --force-update
    ```
    {: pre}

### Disabling automatic updates for the Ingress ALB add-on and manually updating ALB pods
{: #alb}

Control when the Ingress application load balancer (ALB) add-on is updated.
{: shortdesc}

When the ALB add-on is updated, the `nginx-ingress` and `ingress-auth` containers in all ALB pods are updated to the latest build version. By default, automatic updates to the add-on are enabled. Updates are performed on a rolling basis so that your Ingress ALBs don't experience any downtime.

If you disable automatic updates, you are responsible for updating the add-on. As updates become available, you are notified in the CLI when you run the `ibmcloud ks albs` or `alb-autoupdate-get` commands.

When you update the major or minor Kubernetes version of your cluster, IBM automatically makes necessary changes to the Ingress deployment, but does not change the build version of your Ingress ALB add-on. You are responsible for checking the compatability of the latest Kubernetes versions and your Ingress ALB add-on images.
{: note}

Before you begin:

1. Verify that your ALBs are running.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks albs
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Check the status of automatic updates for the Ingress ALB add-on.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb-autoupdate-get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output when automatic updates are enabled:
    ```
    Retrieving automatic update status of application load balancer (ALB) pods in cluster mycluster...
    OK
    Automatic updates of the ALB pods are enabled in cluster mycluster
    ALBs are at the latest version in cluster mycluster
    ```
    {: screen}

    Example output when automatic updates are disabled:
    ```
    Retrieving automatic update status of application load balancer (ALB) pods in cluster mycluster...
    OK
    Automatic updates of the ALB pods are disabled in cluster mycluster
    ALBs are not at the latest version in cluster mycluster. To view the current version, run 'ibmcloud ks albs'.
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Verify the current **Build** version of your ALB pods.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks albs --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Status    Type      ALB IP         Zone    Build

You can manage automatic updates of the Ingress ALB add-on in the following ways:
* Disable automatic updates.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb-autoupdate-disable --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}
* Manually update your Ingress ALB add-on.
    1. If an update is available and you want to update the add-on, first check the [changelog for the latest version of the Ingress ALB add-on](cs_versions_addons.html#alb_changelog) to verify any potentially disruptive changes.
    2. Force a one-time update of your ALB pods. All ALB pods in the cluster are updated to the latest build version. You cannot update an individual ALB or choose which build to update the add-on to. Automatic updates remain disabled.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks alb-update --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}
* If your ALB pods were recently updated, but a custom configuration for your ALBs is affected by the latest build, you can roll back the update to the build that your ALB pods were previously running. **Note**: After you roll back an update, automatic updates for ALB pods are disabled.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb-rollback --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}
* Re-enable automatic updates. Whenever the next build becomes available, the ALB pods are automatically updated to the latest build.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks alb-autoupdate-enable --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```

## Updating from stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools
{: #standalone_to_workerpool}

With the introduction of multizone clusters, worker nodes with the same configuration, such as the machine type, are grouped in worker pools. When you create a new cluster, a worker pool that is named `default` is automatically created for you.
{: shortdesc}

You can use worker pools to spread worker nodes evenly across zones and build a balanced cluster. Balanced clusters are more available and resilient to failures. If a worker node is removed from a zone, you can rebalance the worker pool and automatically provision new worker nodes to that zone. Worker pools are also used to install Kubernetes version updates to all of your worker nodes.  

**Important:** If you created clusters before multizone clusters became available, your worker nodes are still stand-alone and not automatically grouped into worker pools. You must update these clusters to use worker pools. If not updated, you cannot change your single zone cluster to a multizone cluster.

Review the following image to see how your cluster setup changes when you move from stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools.

<img src="images/cs_cluster_migrate.png" alt="Update your cluster from stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools" width="600" style="width:600px; border-style: none"/>

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. Target the appropriate region and, if applicable, resource group. Set the context for your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).

1. List existing stand-alone worker nodes in your cluster and note the **ID**, the **Machine Type**, and **Private IP**.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Create a worker pool and decide on the machine type and the number of worker nodes that you want to add to the pool.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker-pool-create --name <pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --machine-type <machine_type> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. List available zones and decide where you want to provision the worker nodes in your worker pool. To view the zone where your stand-alone worker nodes are provisioned, run `ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID>`. If you want to spread your worker nodes across multiple zones, choose a [multizone-capable zone](cs_regions.html#zones).
   ```
   ibmcloud ks zones
   ```
   {: pre}

4. List available VLANs for the zone that you chose in the previous step. If you do not have a VLAN in that zone yet, the VLAN is automatically created for you when you add the zone to the worker pool.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks vlans <zone>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Add the zone to your worker pool. When you add a zone to a worker pool, the worker nodes that are defined in your worker pool are provisioned in the zone and considered for future workload scheduling. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} automatically adds the `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region` label for the region and the `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` label for the zone to each worker node. The Kubernetes scheduler uses these labels to spread pods across zones within the same region.
   1. **To add a zone to one worker pool**: Replace `<pool_name>` with the name of your worker pool, and fill in the cluster ID, zone, and VLANs with the information you previously retrieved. If you do not have a private and a public VLAN in that zone, do not specify this option. A private and a public VLAN are automatically created for you.

      If you want to use different VLANs for different worker pools, repeat this command for each VLAN and its corresponding worker pools. Any new worker nodes are added to the VLANs that you specify, but the VLANs for any existing worker nodes are not changed.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks zone-add --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pools <pool_name> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. **To add the zone to multiple worker pools**: Add multiple worker pools to the `ibmcloud ks zone-add` command. To add multiple worker pools to a zone, you must have an existing private and public VLAN in that zone. If you do not have a public and private VLAN in that zone, consider adding the zone to one worker pool first so that a public and a private VLAN are created for you. Then, you can add the zone to other worker pools. </br></br>It is important that the worker nodes in all your worker pools are provisioned into all the zones to ensure that your cluster is balanced across zones. If you want to use different VLANs for different worker pools, repeat this command with the VLAN that you want to use for your worker pool. If you have multiple VLANs for a cluster, multiple subnets on the same VLAN, or a multizone cluster, you must enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/infrastructure/vlans/vlan-spanning.html#vlan-spanning) for your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account so your worker nodes can communicate with each other on the private network. To perform this action, you need the **Network > Manage Network VLAN Spanning** [infrastructure permission](cs_users.html#infra_access), or you can request the account owner to enable it. To check if VLAN spanning is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud ks vlan-spanning-get` [command](/docs/containers/cs_cli_reference.html#cs_vlan_spanning_get). If you are using {{site.data.keyword.BluDirectLink}}, you must instead use a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link/subnet-configuration.html#more-about-using-vrf). To enable VRF, contact your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account representative.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks zone-add --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pools <pool_name1,pool_name2,pool_name3> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. **To add multiple zones to your worker pools**: Repeat the `ibmcloud ks zone-add` command with a different zone and specify the worker pools that you want to provision in that zone. By adding more zones to your cluster, you change your cluster from a single zone cluster to a [multizone cluster](cs_clusters_planning.html#multizone).

6. Wait for the worker nodes to be deployed in each zone.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}
   When the worker node state changes to **Normal** the deployment is finished.

7. Remove your stand-alone worker nodes. If you have multiple stand-alone worker nodes, remove one at a time.
   1. List the worker nodes in your cluster and compare the private IP address from this command with the private IP address that you retrieved in the beginning to find your stand-alone worker nodes.
      ```
      kubectl get nodes
      ```
      {: pre}
   2. Mark the worker node as unschedulable in a process that is known as cordoning. When you cordon a worker node, you make it unavailable for future pod scheduling. Use the `name` that is returned in the `kubectl get nodes` command.
      ```
      kubectl cordon <worker_name>
      ```
      {: pre}
   3. Verify that pod scheduling is disabled for your worker node.
      ```
      kubectl get nodes
      ```
      {: pre}
      Your worker node is disabled for pod scheduling if the status displays **SchedulingDisabled**.
   4. Force pods to be removed from your stand-alone worker node and rescheduled onto remaining uncordoned stand-alone worker nodes and worker nodes from your worker pool.
      ```
      kubectl drain <worker_name> --ignore-daemonsets
      ```
      {: pre}
      This process can take a few minutes.

   5. Remove your stand-alone worker node. Use the ID of the worker node that you retrieved with the `ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>` command.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks worker-rm <cluster_name_or_ID> <worker_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}
   6. Repeat these steps until all your stand-alone worker nodes are removed.


**What's next?** </br>
Now that you updated your cluster to use worker pools, you can, improve availability by adding more zones to your cluster. Adding more zones to your cluster changes your cluster from a single zone cluster to a [multizone cluster](cs_clusters_planning.html#ha_clusters). When you change your single zone cluster to a multizone cluster, your Ingress domain changes from `<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.mybluemix.net` to `<cluster_name>.<region_or_zone>.containers.appdomain.cloud`. The existing Ingress domain is still valid and can be used to send requests to your apps.
