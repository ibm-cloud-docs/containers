# Updating clusters, worker nodes, and cluster components
{: #update}

You can install updates to keep your Kubernetes clusters up-to-date in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Updating the Kubernetes master
{: #master}

Periodically, the Kubernetes project releases [major, minor, or patch updates](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#version_types). Updates can affect the Kubernetes API server version or other components in your Kubernetes master. IBM updates the patch version, but you must update the master major and minor versions.
{:shortdesc}

**How do I know when to update the master?**</br>
You are notified in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console and CLI when updates are available, and can also check the [supported versions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) page.

**How many versions behind the latest can the master be?**</br>
IBM generally supports three versions of Kubernetes at a time. You can update the Kubernetes API server no more than two versions ahead of its current version.

For example, if your current Kubernetes API server version is 1.13 and you want to update to 1.16, you must first update to 1.14.

If your cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version, follow the [version archive instructions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#k8s_version_archive). To avoid getting in an unsupported state and operational impact, keep your cluster up-to-date.

**Can my worker nodes run a later version than the master?**</br>
Your worker nodes cannot run a later `major.minor` Kubernetes version than the master. First, [update your master](#update_master) to the latest Kubernetes version. Then, [update the worker nodes](#worker_node) in your cluster.

Worker nodes can run later patch versions than the master, such as patch versions that are specific to worker nodes for security updates.
<br>

**How are patch updates applied?**</br>
By default, patch updates for the master are applied automatically over the course of several days, so a master patch version might show up as available before it is applied to your master. The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another. In any of these cases, you can [check the versions changelog](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) for any potential impact and choose to safely use the `ibmcloud ks cluster master update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.

Unlike the master, you must update your workers for each patch version.


**What happens during the master update?**</br>
Your master is highly available with three replica master pods. The master pods have a rolling update, during which only one pod is unavailable at a time. Two instances are up and running so that you can access and change the cluster during the update. Your worker nodes, apps, and resources continue to run.

For clusters that run previous versions of Kubernetes, when you update the Kubernetes API server, the API server is down for about 5 - 10 minutes. During the update, you cannot access or change the cluster. However, worker nodes, apps, and resources that cluster users deployed are not modified and continue to run.

**Can I roll back the update?**</br>
No, you cannot roll back a cluster to a previous version after the update process takes place. Be sure to use a test cluster and follow the instructions to address potential issues before you update your production master.

**What process can I follow to update the master?**</br>
The following diagram shows the process that you can take to update your master.

![Master update best practice](/images/update-tree.png)

Figure 1. Updating Kubernetes master process diagram
{: #update_master}

Before you begin, make sure that you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform).

To update the Kubernetes master _major_ or _minor_ version:

1.  Review the [Kubernetes changes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) and make any updates marked _Update before master_.

2.  Update your API server and associated master components by using the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) or running the CLI `ibmcloud ks cluster master update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update).

3.  Wait a few minutes, then confirm that the update is complete. Review the API server version on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} clusters dashboard or run `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`.

4.  Install the version of the [`kubectl cli`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) that matches the API server version that runs in the master. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are two or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).

When the master update is complete, you can update your worker nodes, depending on the type of cluster infrastructure provider that you have.
*  [Updating classic worker nodes](#worker_node).
*  [Updating VPC worker nodes](#vpc_worker_node).

<br />


## Updating classic worker nodes
{: #worker_node}

You received a notification to update your worker nodes in a [classic infrastructure](/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers) cluster. What does that mean? As security updates and patches are put in place for the API server and other master components, you must be sure that the worker nodes remain in sync.
{: shortdesc}

<img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Applies to only classic clusters. Have a VPC cluster? See [Updating VPC worker nodes](#vpc_worker_node) instead.
{: note}

**What happens to my apps during an update?**</br>
If you run apps as part of a deployment on worker nodes that you update, the apps are rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster. These worker nodes might be in a different worker pool, or if you have stand-alone worker nodes, apps might be scheduled onto stand-alone worker nodes. To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload.

**How can I control how many worker nodes go down at a time during the update?**</br>
If you need all your worker nodes to be up and running, consider [resizing your worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_resize) or [adding stand-alone worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_add) to add more worker nodes. You can remove the additional worker nodes after the update is completed.

In addition, you can create a Kubernetes config map that specifies the maximum number of worker nodes that can be unavailable at a time during the update. Worker nodes are identified by the worker node labels. You can use IBM-provided labels or custom labels that you added to the worker node.

**What if I choose not to define a config map?**</br>
When the config map is not defined, the default is used. By default, a maximum of 20% of all of your worker nodes in each cluster can be unavailable during the update process.

### Prerequisites
{: #worker-up-prereqs}

Before you update your classic infrastructure worker nodes, review the prerequisite steps.
{: shortdesc}

Updates to worker nodes can cause downtime for your apps and services. Your worker node machine is reimaged, and data is deleted if not [stored outside the pod](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).
{: important}

- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
- [Update the master](#master). The worker node version cannot be higher than the API server version that runs in your Kubernetes master.
- Make any changes that are marked with _Update after master_ in the [Kubernetes version preparation guide](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
- If you want to apply a patch update, review the [Kubernetes version changelog](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog).
- Consider [adding more worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers) so that your cluster has enough capacity to rescheduling your workloads during the update.
- Make sure that you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform).

### Updating classic worker nodes in the CLI with a configmap
{: #worker-up-configmap}

Set up a configmap to perform a rolling update of your classic worker nodes.
{: shortdesc}

1.  Complete the [prerequisite steps](#worker-up-prereqs).
2.  List available worker nodes and note their private IP address.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. View the labels of a worker node. You can find the worker node labels in the **Labels** section of your CLI output. Every label consists of a `NodeSelectorKey` and a `NodeSelectorValue`.
   ```
   kubectl describe node <private_worker_IP>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   Name:               10.184.58.3
   Roles:              <none>
   Labels:             arch=amd64
                    beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64
                    beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=us-south
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=dal12
                    ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/encrypted-docker-data=true
                    ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/iaas-provider=softlayer
                    ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/machine-type=u3c.2x4.encrypted
                    kubernetes.io/hostname=10.123.45.3
                    privateVLAN=2299001
                    publicVLAN=2299012
   Annotations:        node.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=0
                    volumes.kubernetes.io/controller-managed-attach-detach=true
   CreationTimestamp:  Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:26:17 -0400
   Taints:             <none>
   Unschedulable:      false
   ```
   {: screen}

4. Create a config map and define the unavailability rules for your worker nodes. The following example shows four checks, the `zonecheck.json`, `regioncheck.json`, `defaultcheck.json`, and a check template. You can use these example checks to define rules for worker nodes in a specific zone (`zonecheck.json`), region (`regioncheck.json`), or for all worker nodes that do not match any of the checks that you defined in the config map (`defaultcheck.json`). Use the check template to create your own check. For every check, to identify a worker node, you must choose one of the worker node labels that you retrieved in the previous step.  

   For every check, you can set only one value for <code>NodeSelectorKey</code> and <code>NodeSelectorValue</code>. If you want to set rules for more than one region, zone, or other worker node labels, create a new check. Define up to 10 checks in a config map. If you add more checks, they are ignored.
   {: note}

   Example:
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cluster-update-configuration
     namespace: kube-system
   data:
    drain_timeout_seconds: "120"
    zonecheck.json: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": 30,
        "NodeSelectorKey": "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone",
        "NodeSelectorValue": "dal13"
      }
    regioncheck.json: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": 20,
        "NodeSelectorKey": "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region",
        "NodeSelectorValue": "us-south"
      }
    defaultcheck.json: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": 20
      }
    <check_name>: |
      {
        "MaxUnavailablePercentage": <value_in_percentage>,
        "NodeSelectorKey": "<node_selector_key>",
        "NodeSelectorValue": "<node_selector_value>"
      }
   ```

        <td>The label value that the worker node must have to be considered for the rule that you define. </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>

5. Create the configuration map in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f <filepath/configmap.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}

6.  Verify that the config map is created.
    ```
    kubectl get configmap --namespace kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

7.  Update the worker nodes.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker update --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node1_ID> --worker <worker_node2_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

8. Optional: Verify the events that are triggered by the config map and any validation errors that occur. The events can be reviewed in the  **Events** section of your CLI output.
   ```
   kubectl describe -n kube-system cm ibm-cluster-update-configuration
   ```
   {: pre}

9. Confirm that the update is complete by reviewing the Kubernetes version of your worker nodes.  
   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
   {: pre}

10. Verify that you do not have duplicate worker nodes. In some cases, older clusters might list duplicate worker nodes with a **`NotReady`** status after an update. To remove duplicates, see [troubleshooting](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#cs_duplicate_nodes).

Next steps:
-   Repeat the update process with other worker pools.
-   Inform developers who work in the cluster to update their `kubectl` CLI to the version of the Kubernetes master.
-   If the Kubernetes dashboard does not display utilization graphs, [delete the `kube-dashboard` pod](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_health#cs_dashboard_graphs).

### Updating classic worker nodes in the console
{: #worker_up_console}

After you set up the config map for the first time, you can then update worker nodes by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
{: shortdesc}

To update worker nodes from the console:
1.  Complete the [prerequisite steps](#worker-up-prereqs) and [set up a config map](#worker_node) to control how your worker nodes are updated.
2.  From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/) menu ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu icon"), click **Kubernetes**.
3.  From the **Clusters** page, click your cluster.
4.  From the **Worker Nodes** tab, select the checkbox for each worker node that you want to update. An action bar is displayed over the table header row.
5.  From the action bar, click **Update**.

<br />


## Updating VPC worker nodes
{: #vpc_worker_node}

You received a notification to update your worker nodes in a [VPC infrastructure cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers). What does that mean? As security updates and patches are put in place for the API server and other master components, you must be sure that the worker nodes remain in sync. You can make two types of updates: updating only the patch version, or updating the `major.minor` version with the patch version.
{: shortdesc}

<img src="images/icon-vpc.png" alt="VPC infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/>  Applies to only VPC clusters. Have a classic cluster? See [Updating classic worker nodes](#worker_node) instead.
{: note}

* **Patch**: A worker node patch update includes security fixes. You can update the VPC worker node to the latest patch by using the `ibmcloud ks worker replace` command.
* **Major.minor**: A `major.minor` update moves up the Kubernetes version of the worker node to the same version as the master. This type of update often includes changes to the Kubernetes API or other behaviors that you must prepare your cluster for. You can update the VPC worker node to the same patch by using the `ibmcloud ks worker replace` command with the `--update` flag.

For more information, see [Update types](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#update_types).

**What happens to my apps during an update?**</br>
If you run apps as part of a deployment on worker nodes that you update, the apps are rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster. These worker nodes might be in a different worker pool. To avoid downtime for your app, you must ensure that you have enough capacity in the cluster to carry the workload, such as by [resizing your worker pools](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#resize_pool).

**What happens to my worker node during an update?**<br>
You VPC worker node is replaced by removing the old worker node and provisioning a new worker node that runs at the updated patch or `major.minor` version. The replacement worker node is created in the same zone, same worker pool, and with the same flavor as the deleted worker node. However, the replacement worker node is assigned a new private IP address, and loses any custom labels that you applied to the old worker node (worker pool labels are still applied to the replacement worker node).

### Prerequisites
{: #vpc_worker_prereqs}

Before you update your VPC infrastructure worker nodes, review the prerequisite steps.
{: shortdesc}

Updates to worker nodes can cause downtime for your apps and services. Your worker node machine is removed, and data is deleted if not [stored outside the pod](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).

### Updating VPC worker nodes in the CLI
{: #vpc_worker_cli}

Before you update your VPC worker nodes, review the prerequisite steps.
{: shortdesc}

1.  Complete the [prerequisite steps](#vpc_worker_prereqs).
2.  Optional: Add capacity to your cluster by [resizing the worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#resize_pool). The pods on the worker node can be rescheduled and continue running on the added worker nodes during the update.
3.  List the worker nodes in your cluster and note the **ID** and **Primary IP** of the worker node that you want to update.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.  Drain the worker node to reschedule the pods onto remaining worker nodes in the cluster and to make it unavailable for future pod scheduling.
    ```
    kubectl drain <worker_node_primary_IP>
    ```
    {: pre}
    Example output:
    ```
    node/10.xxx.xx.xxx cordoned
    evicting pod "<pod_name>"
    ...
    pod/<pod_name> evicted
    ...
    node/10.xxx.xx.xxx evicted
    ```
    {: screen}
5.  Replace the worker node to update either the patch version or the `major.minor` version that matches the master version.
    *  To update the worker node to the same `major.minor` version as the master, such as from 1.15.8 to 1.16.5, include the `--update` flag.
       ```
       ibmcloud ks worker replace --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node_ID> --update
       ```
       {: pre}
    *  To update the worker node to the latest patch version at the same `major.minor` version, such as from 1.15.8_1530 to 1.15.9_1533, do not include the `--update` flag.
       ```
       ibmcloud ks worker replace --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node_ID>
       ```
       {: pre}
6.  Repeat these steps for each worker node that you must update.
7.  Optional: After the replaced worker nodes are in a **Ready** status, [resize the worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#resize_pool) to meet the cluster capacity that you want.

### Updating VPC worker nodes in the console
{: #vpc_worker_ui}

You can update your VPC worker nodes in the console. Before you begin, consider [adding more worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers) to the cluster and [draining](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/){: external} the worker node before you replace, to help avoid downtime for your apps.
{: shortdesc}

1.  Complete the [prerequisite steps](#vpc_worker_prereqs).
2.  From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/) menu ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu icon"), click **Kubernetes**.
3.  From the **Clusters** page, click your cluster.
4.  From the **Worker Nodes** tab, select the checkbox for each worker node that you want to update. An action bar is displayed over the table header row.
5.  From the action bar, click **Update**.

<br />


## Updating flavors (machine types)
{: #machine_type}

You can update the flavors, or machine types, of your worker nodes by adding new worker nodes and removing the old ones. For example, if your cluster has deprecated `x1c` or older Ubuntu 16 `x2c` worker node flavors, create Ubuntu 18 worker nodes that use flavors with `x3c` in the names.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
- If you store data on your worker node, the data is deleted if not [stored outside the worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).
- Make sure that you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform).

To update flavors:

1. List available worker nodes and note their private IP address.
   - **For worker nodes in a worker pool**:
     1. List available worker pools in your cluster.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. List the worker nodes in the worker pool. Note the **ID** and **Private IP**.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <pool_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

     3. Get the details for a worker node. In the output, note the zone and either the private and public VLAN ID for classic clusters or the subnet ID for VPC clusters.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

   - **Deprecated: For stand-alone worker nodes**:
     1. List available worker nodes. Note the **ID** and **Private IP**.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Get the details for a worker node and note the zone, the private VLAN ID, and the public VLAN ID.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

2. List available flavors in the zone.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks flavors --zone <zone>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Create a worker node with the new machine type.
   - **For worker nodes in a worker pool**:
     1. Create a worker pool with the number of worker nodes that you want to replace.
        * Classic clusters:
          ```
          ibmcloud ks worker-pool create classic --name <pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --machine-type <flavor> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone>
          ```
          {: pre}
        * VPC Generation 1 clusters:
          ```
          ibmcloud ks worker-pool create vpc-classic --name <name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --flavor <flavor> --size-per-zone <number_of_worker_nodes> --label <key>=<value>
          ```
          {: pre}

     2. Verify that the worker pool is created.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     3. Add the zone to your worker pool that you retrieved earlier. When you add a zone, the worker nodes that are defined in your worker pool are provisioned in the zone and considered for future workload scheduling. If you want to spread your worker nodes across multiple zones, choose a [multizone-capable zone](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones).
       * Classic clusters:
         ```
         ibmcloud ks zone add classic --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <pool_name> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
         ```
         {: pre}
       * VPC Generation 1 clusters:
         ```
         ibmcloud ks zone add vpc-classic --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <pool_name> --subnet-id <vpc_subnet_id>
         ```
         {: pre}

   - **Deprecated: For stand-alone worker nodes**:
       ```
       ibmcloud ks worker add --cluster <cluster_name> --machine-type <flavor> --workers <number_of_worker_nodes> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
       ```
       {: pre}

4. Wait for the worker nodes to be deployed. When the worker node state changes to **Normal**, the deployment is finished.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}
5.  To prevent downtime, reschedule the apps from the old worker nodes before you delete the old worker nodes.
    1.  Mark the worker node as unschedulable in a process that is known as cordoning. When you cordon a worker node, you make it unavailable for future pod scheduling. Use the **Private IP** of the worker node that you retrieved earlier, which is the worker node name in Kubernetes.
        ```
        kubectl cordon <private_IP_address_of_worker_node>
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  Verify that pod scheduling is disabled for the worker node by checking that the status is **SchedulingDisabled**.
        ```
        kubectl get nodes
        ```
        {: pre}
    3.  Force pods to be removed from your worker node and rescheduled onto remaining worker nodes in the cluster. This process can take a few minutes.
        ```
        kubectl drain <worker_name>
        ```
        {: pre}
6. Remove the old worker node. **Note**: If you are removing a flavor that is billed monthly (such as bare metal), you are charged for the entire the month.
   - **For worker nodes in a worker pool**:
     1. Remove the worker pool with the old machine type. Removing a worker pool removes all worker nodes in the pool in all zones. This process might take a few minutes to complete.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool rm --worker-pool <pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

     2. Verify that the worker pool is removed.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

   - **Deprecated: For stand-alone worker nodes**:
      ```
      ibmcloud ks worker rm --cluster <cluster_name> --worker <worker_node>
      ```
      {: pre}

7. Verify that the worker nodes are removed from your cluster.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

8. Repeat these steps to update other worker pools or stand-alone worker nodes to different flavors.

## Updating cluster components
{: #components}

Your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster comes with components, such as Ingress, that are installed automatically when you provision the cluster. By default, these components are updated automatically by IBM. However, you can disable automatic updates for some components and manually update them separately from the master and worker nodes.
{: shortdesc}

**What default components can I update separately from the cluster?**</br>
You can optionally disable automatic updates for the following components:
* [Fluentd for logging](#logging-up)
* [Ingress application load balancer (ALB)](#alb)

**Are there components that I can't update separately from the cluster?**</br>

Yes. Your cluster is deployed with the following managed components and associated resources that cannot be changed, except to scale pods or edit configmaps for certain performance benefits. If you try to change one of these deployment components, their original settings are restored on a regular interval when they are updated with the cluster master. However, note that resources that you create that are associated with these components, such as Calico network policies that you create to be implemented by the Calico deployment components, are not updated.

* `calico`
* `coredns`
* `coredns-autoscaler`
* `heapster`
* `ibm-file-plugin`
* `ibm-storage-watcher`
* `ibm-keepalived-watcher`
* `kube-dns-amd64`
* `kube-dns-autoscaler`
* `kubernetes-dashboard`
* `metrics-server`
* `vpn`
* In gateway-enabled classic clusters, `ibm-gateway-controller`

**Can I install other plug-ins or add-ons than the default components?**</br>
Yes. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides other plugin-ins and add-ons that you can choose from to add capabilities to your cluster. For example, you might want to [use Helm charts](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#public_helm_install) to install the [block storage plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#install_block) or [strongSwan VPN](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpn#vpn-setup). Or you might want to enable IBM-managed add-ons in your cluster, such as [Istio](/docs/containers?topic=containers-istio) or [Knative](/docs/containers?topic=containers-serverless-apps-knative). You must update these Helm charts and add-ons separately by following the instructions in the Helm chart readme files or by following the steps to [update managed add-ons](/docs/containers?topic=containers-managed-addons#updating-managed-add-ons).

### Managing automatic updates for Fluentd
{: #logging-up}

When you create a logging configuration for a source in your cluster to forward to an external server, a Fluentd component is created in your cluster. In order to change your logging or filter configurations, the Fluentd component must be at the latest version. By default, automatic updates to the component are enabled.
{: shortdesc}

As of 14 November 2019, a Fluentd component is created for your cluster only if you [create a logging configuration to forward logs to a syslog server](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#configuring). If no logging configurations for syslog exist in your cluster, the Fluentd component is removed automatically. If you do not forward logs to syslog and want to ensure that the Fluentd component is removed from your cluster, automatic updates to Fluentd must be enabled.
{: important}

You can manage automatic updates of the Fluentd component in the following ways. **Note**: To run the following commands, you must have the [**Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for the cluster.

* Check whether automatic updates are enabled by running the `ibmcloud ks logging autoupdate get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_log_autoupdate_get).
* Disable automatic updates by running the `ibmcloud ks logging autoupdate disable` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_log_autoupdate_disable).
* If automatic updates are disabled, but you need to change your configuration, you have two options:
    * Turn on automatic updates for your Fluentd pods.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks logging autoupdate enable --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}
    * Force a one-time update when you use a logging command that includes the `--force-update` option. **Note**: Your pods update to the latest version of the Fluentd component, but Fluentd does not update automatically going forward.
        Example command:

        ```
        ibmcloud ks logging config update --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --id <log_config_ID> --type <log_type> --force-update
        ```
        {: pre}

### Managing automatic updates for Ingress ALBs
{: #alb}

Control when the Ingress application load balancer (ALB) component is updated.
{: shortdesc}

When the Ingress ALB component is updated, the `nginx-ingress` and `ingress-auth` containers in all ALB pods are updated to the latest build version. By default, automatic updates to ALBs are enabled. Updates are performed on a rolling basis so that your Ingress ALBs don't experience any downtime. When a pod restarts after the update is applied, a [readiness check](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress-settings#readiness-check) prevents the ALB pod from attempting to route traffic requests until all of the Ingress resource files are parsed. This readiness check prevents request loss during ALB pod updates and can take up to 5 minutes.

If you disable automatic updates, you are responsible for updating your ALBs. As updates become available, you are notified in the CLI when you run the `ibmcloud ks alb ls` or `alb autoupdate get` commands.

When you update the major or minor Kubernetes version of your cluster, IBM automatically makes necessary changes to the Ingress deployment, but does not change the build version of your Ingress ALBs. You are responsible for checking the compatibility of the latest Kubernetes versions and your Ingress ALBs' images.
{: note}

Before you begin:

1. Verify that your ALBs are running.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb ls
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Check the status of automatic updates for the Ingress ALB component.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb autoupdate get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output when automatic updates are enabled:
    ```
    Retrieving automatic update status of application load balancer (ALB) pods in cluster mycluster...
    OK
    Automatic updates of the ALB pods are enabled in cluster mycluster
    ALBs are at the latest version in cluster mycluster
    ```
    {: screen}

    Example output when automatic updates are disabled:
    ```
    Retrieving automatic update status of application load balancer (ALB) pods in cluster mycluster...
    OK
    Automatic updates of the ALB pods are disabled in cluster mycluster
    ALBs are not at the latest version in cluster mycluster. To view the current version, run 'ibmcloud ks alb ls'.
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Verify the current **Build** version of your ALB pods.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP          Zone    Build                           ALB VLAN ID   NLB Version
    private-crdf253b6025d64944ab99ed63bb4567b6-alb2   false     disabled   private   10.xxx.xx.xxx   dal10   ingress:411/ingress-auth:315*   2294021       -
    public-crdf253b6025d64944ab99ed63bb4567b6-alb2    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal10   ingress:411/ingress-auth:315*   2234945       -

    * An update is available for the ALB pods. Review any potentially disruptive changes for the latest version before you update: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#alb
    ```
    {: screen}

You can manage automatic updates of the Ingress ALB component in the following ways. **Note**: To run the following commands, you must have the [**Editor** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for the cluster.
* Disable automatic updates.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb autoupdate disable --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}
* Manually update your Ingress ALBs.
    1. If an update is available and you want to update your ALBs, first check the [changelog for the latest version of the Ingress ALB component](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-add-ons-changelog#alb_changelog) to verify any potentially disruptive changes.
    2. Force a one-time update of your ALB pods. All ALB pods in the cluster are updated to the latest build version. You cannot update an individual ALB or choose which build to update ALBs to. Automatic updates remain disabled.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks alb update --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}
* If your ALB pods were recently updated, but a custom configuration for your ALBs is affected by the latest build, you can roll back the update to the build that your ALB pods were previously running. **Note**: After you roll back an update, automatic updates for ALB pods are disabled.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb rollback --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}
* Re-enable automatic updates. Whenever the next build becomes available, the ALB pods are automatically updated to the latest build.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb autoupdate enable --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

## Updating managed add-ons
{: #addons}

Managed {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} add-ons are an easy way to enhance your cluster with open-source capabilities, such as Istio or Knative. The version of the open-source tool that you add to your cluster is tested by IBM and approved for use in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. To update managed add-ons that you enabled in your cluster to the latest versions, see [Updating managed add-ons](/docs/containers?topic=containers-managed-addons#updating-managed-add-ons).




## Updating from stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools
{: #standalone_to_workerpool}

With the introduction of multizone clusters, worker nodes with the same configuration, such as the machine type, are grouped in worker pools. When you create a new cluster, a worker pool that is named `default` is automatically created for you.
{: shortdesc}

<img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Applies to only classic clusters. VPC clusters always use worker pools.
{: note}

You can use worker pools to spread worker nodes evenly across zones and build a balanced cluster. Balanced clusters are more available and resilient to failures. If a worker node is removed from a zone, you can rebalance the worker pool and automatically provision new worker nodes to that zone. Worker pools are also used to install Kubernetes version updates to all of your worker nodes.  

If you created clusters before multizone clusters became available, your worker nodes are still stand-alone and not automatically grouped into worker pools. You must update these clusters to use worker pools. If not updated, you cannot change your single zone cluster to a multizone cluster.
{: important}

Review the following image to see how your cluster setup changes when you move from stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools.

<img src="images/cs_cluster_migrate.png" alt="Update your cluster from stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools" width="600" style="width:600px; border-style: none"/>

Before you begin:
- Ensure that you have the [**Operator** or **Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for the cluster.
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To update stand-alone worker nodes to worker pools:

1. List existing stand-alone worker nodes in your cluster and note the **ID**, the **Machine Type**, and **Private IP**.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Create a worker pool and decide on the flavor and the number of worker nodes that you want to add to the pool.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker-pool create classic --name <pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --machine-type <flavor> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. List available zones and decide where you want to provision the worker nodes in your worker pool. To view the zone where your stand-alone worker nodes are provisioned, run `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`. If you want to spread your worker nodes across multiple zones, choose a [multizone-capable zone](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones).
   ```
   ibmcloud ks zone ls
   ```
   {: pre}

4. List available VLANs for the zone that you chose in the previous step. If you do not have a VLAN in that zone yet, the VLAN is automatically created for you when you add the zone to the worker pool.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks vlan ls --zone <zone>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Add the zone to your worker pool. When you add a zone to a worker pool, the worker nodes that are defined in your worker pool are provisioned in the zone and considered for future workload scheduling. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} automatically adds the `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region` label for the region and the `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` label for the zone to each worker node. The Kubernetes scheduler uses these labels to spread pods across zones within the same region.
   1. **To add a zone to one worker pool**: Replace `<pool_name>` with the name of your worker pool, and fill in the cluster ID, zone, and VLANs with the information you previously retrieved. If you do not have a private and a public VLAN in that zone, do not specify this option. A private and a public VLAN are automatically created for you.

      If you want to use different VLANs for different worker pools, repeat this command for each VLAN and its corresponding worker pools. Any new worker nodes are added to the VLANs that you specify, but the VLANs for any existing worker nodes are not changed.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks zone add classic --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <pool_name> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. **To add the zone to multiple worker pools**: Add multiple worker pools to the `ibmcloud ks zone add classic` command. To add multiple worker pools to a zone, you must have an existing private and public VLAN in that zone. If you do not have a public and private VLAN in that zone, consider adding the zone to one worker pool first so that a public and a private VLAN are created for you. Then, you can add the zone to other worker pools. </br></br>It is important that the worker nodes in all your worker pools are provisioned into all the zones to ensure that your cluster is balanced across zones. If you want to use different VLANs for different worker pools, repeat this command with the VLAN that you want to use for your worker pool. In classic clusters, if you have multiple VLANs for your cluster, multiple subnets on the same VLAN, or a multizone classic cluster, you must enable a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/resources?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud) for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account so your worker nodes can communicate with each other on the private network. To enable VRF, [contact your IBM Cloud infrastructure account representative](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud#how-you-can-initiate-the-conversion). To check whether a VRF is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud account show` command. If you cannot or do not want to enable VRF, enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/infrastructure/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning). To perform this action, you need the **Network > Manage Network VLAN Spanning** [infrastructure permission](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#infra_access), or you can request the account owner to enable it. To check whether VLAN spanning is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud ks vlan spanning get --region <region>` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_vlan_spanning_get).
      ```
      ibmcloud ks zone add classic --zone <zone> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> -w <pool_name1> -w <pool_name2> -w <pool_name3> --private-vlan <private_VLAN_ID> --public-vlan <public_VLAN_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. **To add multiple zones to your worker pools**: Repeat the `ibmcloud ks zone add classic` command with a different zone and specify the worker pools that you want to provision in that zone. By adding more zones to your cluster, you change your cluster from a single zone cluster to a [multizone cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#multizone).

6. Wait for the worker nodes to be deployed in each zone.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}
   When the worker node state changes to **Normal** the deployment is finished.

7. Remove your stand-alone worker nodes. If you have multiple stand-alone worker nodes, remove one at a time.
   1. List the worker nodes in your cluster and compare the private IP address from this command with the private IP address that you retrieved in the beginning to find your stand-alone worker nodes.
      ```
      kubectl get nodes
      ```
      {: pre}
   2. Mark the worker node as unschedulable in a process that is known as cordoning. When you cordon a worker node, you make it unavailable for future pod scheduling. Use the `name` that is returned in the `kubectl get nodes` command.
      ```
      kubectl cordon <worker_name>
      ```
      {: pre}
   3. Verify that pod scheduling is disabled for your worker node.
      ```
      kubectl get nodes
      ```
      {: pre}
      Your worker node is disabled for pod scheduling if the status displays **`SchedulingDisabled`**.
   4. Force pods to be removed from your stand-alone worker node and rescheduled onto remaining uncordoned stand-alone worker nodes and worker nodes from your worker pool.
      ```
      kubectl drain <worker_name> --ignore-daemonsets
      ```
      {: pre}
      This process can take a few minutes.

   5. Remove your stand-alone worker node. Use the ID of the worker node that you retrieved with the `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` command.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks worker rm --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}
   6. Repeat these steps until all your stand-alone worker nodes are removed.


**What's next?** </br>
Now that you updated your cluster to use worker pools, you can, improve availability by adding more zones to your cluster. Adding more zones to your cluster changes your cluster from a single zone cluster to a [multizone cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#ha_clusters). When you change your single zone cluster to a multizone cluster, your Ingress domain changes from `<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.mybluemix.net` to `<cluster_name>.<region_or_zone>.containers.appdomain.cloud`. The existing Ingress domain is still valid and can be used to send requests to your apps.
