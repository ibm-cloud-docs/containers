# Modifying default Ingress behavior
{: #ingress-settings}

After you expose your apps by creating an Ingress resource, you can further configure the Ingress ALBs in your cluster by setting the following options.
{: shortdesc}

## Opening ports in the Ingress ALB
{: #opening_ingress_ports}

By default, only ports 80 and 443 are exposed in the Ingress ALB. To expose other ports, you can edit the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
{: shortdesc}

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource. 
  ```
  kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Add a <code>data</code> section and specify public ports `80`, `443`, and any other ports you want to expose separated by a semi-colon (;).

    By default, ports 80 and 443 are open. If you want to keep 80 and 443 open, you must also include them in addition to any other ports you specify in the `public-ports` field. Any port that is not specified is closed. If you enabled a private ALB, you must also specify any ports that you want to keep open in the `private-ports` field.
    {: important}
    

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;<port3>"
      private-ports: "80;443;<port4>"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example that keeps ports `80`, `443`, and `9443` open:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;9443"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.
  ```
  kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Optional:
  * Access an app via a non-standard TCP port that you opened by using the [`tcp-ports`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress_annotation#tcp-ports) annotation.
  * Change the default ports for HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) network traffic to a port that you opened by using the [`custom-port`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress_annotation#custom-port) annotation.

## Preserving the source IP address
{: #preserve_source_ip}

<img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> The source IP address for client requests can be preserved in classic clusters only, and cannot be preserved in VPC clusters.
{: note}


By default, the source IP address of the client request is not preserved. When a client request to your app is sent to your cluster, the request is routed to a pod for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB. If no app pod exists on the same worker node as the load balancer service pod, the load balancer forwards the request to an app pod on a different worker node. The source IP address of the package is changed to the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod runs.
{: shortdesc}

To preserve the original source IP address of the client request, you can enable [source IP preservation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/#source-ip-for-services-with-typeloadbalancer). Preserving the client’s IP is useful, for example, when app servers have to apply security and access-control policies.

If you [disable an ALB](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_alb_configure), any source IP changes you make to the load balancer service that exposes the ALB are lost. When you re-enable the ALB, you must enable source IP again.
{: note}

To enable source IP preservation, edit the load balancer service that exposes an Ingress ALB:

1. Enable source IP preservation for a single ALB or for all the ALBs in your cluster.
    * To set up source IP preservation for a single ALB:
        1. Get the ID of the ALB for which you want to enable source IP. The ALB services have a format similar to `public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a public ALB or `private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a private ALB.
            ```
            kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb
            ```
            {: pre}

        2. Open the YAML for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.
            ```
            kubectl edit svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
            ```
            {: pre}

        3. Under **`spec`**, change the value of **`externalTrafficPolicy`** from `Cluster` to `Local`.

        4. Save and close the configuration file. The output is similar to the following:

            ```
            service "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1" edited
            ```
            {: screen}
    * To set up source IP preservation for all public ALBs in your cluster, run the following command:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1", "public-cr17e61e63c6e94b658596ca92d087eed9-alb2" patched
        ```
        {: screen}

    * To set up source IP preservation for all private ALBs in your cluster, run the following command:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        "private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1", "private-cr17e61e63c6e94b658596ca92d087eed9-alb2" patched
        ```
        {: screen}

2. Verify that the source IP is being preserved in your ALB pods logs.
    1. Get the ID of a pod for the ALB that you modified.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep alb
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Open the logs for that ALB pod. Verify that the IP address for the `client` field is the client request IP address instead of the load balancer service IP address.
        ```
        kubectl logs <ALB_pod_ID> nginx-ingress -n kube-system
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Now, when you look up the headers for the requests that are sent to your back-end app, you can see the client IP address in the `x-forwarded-for` header.

4. If you no longer want to preserve the source IP, you can revert the changes that you made to the service.
    * To revert source IP preservation for your public ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}
    * To revert source IP preservation for your private ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

## Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level
{: #ssl_protocols_ciphers}

Enable SSL protocols and ciphers at the global HTTP level by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap.
{:shortdesc}

For example, if you still have legacy clients that require TLS 1.0 or 1.1 support, you must manually enable these TLS versions to override the default setting of TLS 1.2 only. For more information about how to see the TLS versions that your clients use to access your apps, see this [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} blog post](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-kubernetes-service-alb-update-tls-1-0-and-1-1-disabled-by-default).

When you specify the enabled protocols for all hosts, the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 parameters (1.1.13, 1.0.12) work only when OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is used. The TLSv1.3 parameter (1.13.0) works only when OpenSSL 1.1.1 built with TLSv1.3 support is used.
{: note}

To edit the configmap to enable SSL protocols and ciphers:

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add the SSL protocols and ciphers. Format ciphers according to the [OpenSSL library cipher list format ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/ciphers.html).

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ssl-protocols: "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"
     ssl-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!CAMELLIA:!AESCCM:!ECDH+CHACHA20"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

## Increasing the restart readiness check time for ALB pods
{: #readiness-check}

Increase the amount of time that ALB pods have to parse large Ingress resource files when the ALB pods restart.
{: shortdesc}

When an ALB pod restarts, such as after an update is applied, a readiness check prevents the ALB pod from attempting to route traffic requests until all of the Ingress resource files are parsed. This readiness check prevents request loss when ALB pods restart. By default, the readiness check waits 15 seconds after the pod restarts to start checking whether all Ingress files are parsed. If all files are parsed 15 seconds after the pod restarts, the ALB pod begins to route traffic requests again. If all files are not parsed 15 seconds after the pod restarts, the pod does not route traffic, and the readiness check continues to check every 15 seconds for a maximum timeout of 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the ALB pod begins to route traffic.

If you have very large Ingress resource files, it might take longer than 5 minutes for all of the files to be parsed. You can change the default values for the readiness check interval rate and for the total maximum readiness check timeout by adding the `ingress-resource-creation-rate` and `ingress-resource-timeout` settings to the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap.

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. In the **data** section, add the `ingress-resource-creation-rate` and `ingress-resource-timeout` settings. Values can be formatted as seconds (`s`) and minutes (`m`). Example:
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ingress-resource-creation-rate: 1m
     ingress-resource-timeout: 6m
     keep-alive: 8s
     private-ports: 80;443
     public-ports: 80;443
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.
   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

## Sending your custom certificate to legacy clients
{: #default_server_cert}

If you have legacy devices that do not support Server Name Indication (SNI) and you use a [custom TLS certificate in your Ingress resources](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress#public_inside_3), you must edit the ALB's server settings to use your custom TLS certificate and custom TLS secret.
{: shortdesc}

When you create a classic cluster, a Let's Encrypt certificate is generated for the default Ingress secret that IBM provides. If you create a custom secret in your cluster and specify this custom secret for TLS termination in your Ingress resources, the Ingress ALB sends the certificate for your custom secret to the client instead of the default Let's Encrypt certificate. However, if a client does not support SNI, the Ingress ALB defaults to the Let's Encrypt certificate because the default secret is listed in the ALB's default server settings. To send your custom certificate to devices that do not support SNI, complete the following steps to change the ALB's default server settings to your custom secret.

1. Edit the `alb-default-server` Ingress resource.
    ```
    kubectl edit ingress alb-default-server -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. In the `spec.tls` section, change the value of the `hosts.secretName` setting to the name of your custom secret that contains your custom certificate.
   Example:
   ```
   spec:
     rules:
     ...
     tls:
     - hosts:
       - invalid.mycluster-<hash>-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
       secretName: <custom_secret_name>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the resource file.

4. Verify that the resource now points to your custom secret name. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.
   ```
   kubectl get ingress alb-default-server -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

## Tuning ALB performance
{: #perf_tuning}

To optimize performance of your Ingress ALBs, you can change the default settings according to your needs.
{: shortdesc}
</br>

### Adding ALB socket listeners for each NGINX worker process
{: #reuse-port}

Increase the number of socket listeners from one socket listener for each ALB to one socket listener for each NGINX worker process on the worker node by using the `reuse-port` Ingress directive.
{: shortdesc}

When the `reuse-port` option is disabled, a single listening socket notifies ALBs about incoming connections and all worker nodes attempt to take the connection. But when `reuse-port` is enabled, one socket listener exists for each ALB IP address and port combination. Instead of each ALB attempting to take the connection, the Linux kernel determines which available socket listener gets the connection. Lock contention between workers is reduced, which can improve performance. For more information about the benefits and drawbacks of the `reuse-port` directive, see [this NGINX blog post ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.nginx.com/blog/socket-sharding-nginx-release-1-9-1/).

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. In the `data` section, add `reuse-port: "true"`. Example:
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     private-ports: 80;443;9443
     public-ports: 80;443
     reuse-port: "true"
   ...
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

### Enabling log buffering and flush timeout
{: #access-log}

By default, the Ingress ALB logs each request as it arrives. If you have an environment that is heavily used, logging each request as it arrives can greatly increase disk I/O utilization. To avoid continuous disk I/O, you can enable log buffering and flush timeout for the ALB by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` Ingress configmap. When buffering is enabled, instead of performing a separate write operation for each log entry, the ALB buffers a series of entries and writes them to the file together in a single operation.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create and Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Edit the configmap.
    1. Enable log buffering by adding the `access-log-buffering` field and setting it to `"true"`.

    2. Set the threshold for when the ALB should write buffer contents to the log.
        * Time interval: Add the `flush-interval` field and set it to how often the ALB should write to the log. For example, if the default value of `5m` is used, the ALB writes buffer contents to the log once every 5 minutes.
        * Buffer size: Add the `buffer-size` field and set it to how much log memory can be held in the buffer before the ALB writes the buffer contents to the log. For example, if the default value of `100KB` is used, the ALB writes buffer contents to the log every time the buffer reaches 100kb of log content.
        * Time interval or buffer size: When both `flush-interval` and `buffer-size` are set, the ALB writes buffer content to the log based on whichever threshold parameter is met first.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    data:
      access-log-buffering: "true"
      flush-interval: "5m"
      buffer-size: "100KB"
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      ...
    ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that an ALB is configured with the access log changes. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.

   ```
   kubectl logs -n kube-system <ALB_ID> -c nginx-ingress
   ```
   {: pre}

### Changing the number or duration of keepalive connections
{: #keepalive_time}

Keepalive connections can have a major impact on performance by reducing the CPU and network usage that is needed to open and close connections. To optimize the performance of your ALBs, you can change the maximum number of keepalive connections between the ALB and the client and how long the keepalive connections can last.
{: shortdesc}

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change the values of `keep-alive-requests` and `keep-alive`.
    * `keep-alive-requests`: The number of keepalive client connections that can stay open to the Ingress ALB. The default is `4096`.
    * `keep-alive`: The timeout, in seconds, during which the keepalive client connection stays open to the Ingress ALB. The default is `8s`.
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     keep-alive-requests: "4096"
     keep-alive: "8s"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

### Changing the pending connections backlog
{: #backlog}

You can decrease the default backlog setting for how many pending connections can wait in the server queue.
{: shortdesc}

In the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` Ingress configmap, the `backlog` field sets the maximum number of pending connections that can wait in the server queue. By default, `backlog` is set to `32768`. You can override the default by editing the Ingress configmap.

1. Edit the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change the value of `backlog` from `32768` to a lower value. The value must be equal to or lesser than 32768.

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     backlog: "32768"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied. The changes are applied to your ALBs automatically.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

### Tuning kernel performance
{: #ingress_kernel}

To optimize performance of your Ingress ALBs, you can also [change the Linux kernel `sysctl` parameters on worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kernel). Worker nodes are automatically provisioned with optimized kernel tuning, so change these settings only if you have specific performance optimization requirements.
