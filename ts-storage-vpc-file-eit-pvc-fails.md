One possible cause for this issue is that your Cluster and VPC are in different resource groups. If this is true, create your own storage class and retry creating a PVC. If your cluster and VPC are in the same resource group, verify your subnet details, then open a support case and provide your VPC subnet information.
{: tsResolve}


1. Find the resource group of your cluster and VPC. You can find your resource groups in the console or by running the `ibmcloud is resource service-instances -g GROUP` command.


    * **Cluster and VPC are not in the same resource group**: [Create your own storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-file-vpc-apps#storage-file-vpc-custom-sc) and make sure to specify the VPC resource group ID in the `resourceGroup` section as well as the `kube-<clusterID>` security group ID in the `securityGroupIDs` section. You can find the ID of the `kube-<clusterID>` security group by running the following command.
        ```sh
        ibmcloud is sg kube-<cluster-id>  | grep ID
        ```
        {: pre}


    * **Cluster and VPC are in the same resource group**: Check that the `vpc_subnet_ids` property contains valid subnet IDs.

        1. Review the subnet IDs in the `ibm-cloud-provider-data` configmap. 
            ```sh
            kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-data -n kube-system -o yaml | grep vpc_subnet_ids
            ```
            {: pre}


        1. Verify that the subnet IDs you found in the previous step exist.

            ```sh
            ibmcloud is subnets | grep <zone-name>
            ```
            {: pre}

1. If the issue persists, Open a [support case](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar). In the case details, be sure to include any relevant log files, error messages, or command outputs.
