# Getting help
{: #get-help}

Still having issues with your cluster? Review different ways to get help and support for your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters. For any questions or feedback, post in Slack.
{: shortdesc}

## General ways to resolve cluster issues
{: #help-general}
{: support}

1. Keep your cluster environment up to date.
   * Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).
   * [Update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master) to the latest default version for [{{site.data.keyword.containershort}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
2. Make sure that your command line tools are up to date.
   * In the terminal, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up-to-date so that you can use all available commands and flags.
   * Make sure that [your `kubectl` CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).

## Contacting support
{: #help-support}

1. Before you open a support case, gather relevant information about your cluster environment.
   1. Get your cluster details.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks cluster get -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}
   2. If your issue involves worker nodes, get the worker node details.
      1. List all worker nodes in the cluster, and note the **ID** of any worker nodes with an unhealthy **State** or **Status**.
         ```
         ibmcloud ks worker ls -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
         ```
         {: pre}
      2. Get the details of the unhealthy worker node.
         ```
         ibmcloud ks worker get -w <worker_ID> -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
         ```
         {: pre}
   3. For issues with resources within your cluster such as pods or services, log in to the cluster and use the Kubernetes API to get more information about them.

   You can also use the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} Diagnostics and Debug Tool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot#debug_utility) to gather and export pertinent information to share with IBM Support.
   {: tip}

2.  Contact IBM Support by opening a case. To learn about opening an IBM support case, or about support levels and case severities, see [Contacting support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).
3.  In your support case, for **Category**, select **Containers**.
4.  For the **Offering**, select your {{site.data.keyword.containershort}} cluster. Include the relevant information that you previously gathered.
