# Setting up autoscaling for your worker pools
{: #cluster-scaling-install-addon-enable}

Update the cluster autoscaler configmap to enable automatically scaling worker nodes in your worker pools based on the minimum and maximum values that you set.
{: shortdesc}

After you edit the configmap to enable autoscaling on a worker pool, the cluster autoscaler scales your cluster in response to your workload requests. This means you can't [resize](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_resize) or [rebalance](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_rebalance) your worker pools. Scanning and scaling up and down happens at regular intervals over time, and depending on the number of worker nodes might take a longer period of time to complete, such as 30 minutes. Later, if you want to [remove the cluster autoscaler](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-install-addon&interface=ui#autoscaler-remove-console), you must first disable each worker pool in the ConfigMap.



Beginning in version 1.2.4 the `maxEmptyBulkDelete` option is no longer supported. Remove this option from your configmap by running `kubectl edit configmap iks-ca-configmap -n kube-system` command and deleting the option. As a replacement, you can use the `maxScaleDownParallelism` option which was added in version 1.2.4. For more information, see the [configmap reference](#ca-configmap).
{: important}



**Before you begin**:
*  Install the [cluster autoscaler add-on](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-install-addon).
*  [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_cluster)


1. Edit the cluster autoscaler configmap YAML file.
    ```sh
    kubectl edit cm iks-ca-configmap -n kube-system -o yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      workerPoolsConfig.json: |
        [
         {"name": "<worker_pool>","minSize": 1,"maxSize": 2,"enabled":false}
        ]
    kind: ConfigMap
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Edit the ConfigMap with the parameters to define how the cluster autoscaler scales your cluster worker pool. **Note:** Unless you [disabled](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_alb_configure) all public application load balancers (ALBs) in each zone of your standard cluster, you must change the `minSize` to `2` per zone so that the ALB pods can be spread for high availability.

    - `"name": "default"`: Replace `"default"` with the name or ID of the worker pool that you want to scale. To list worker pools, run `ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`. To manage more than one worker pool, copy the JSON line to a comma-separated line, such as follows.
    
        ```sh
        [
        {"name": "default","minSize": 1,"maxSize": 2,"enabled":false},
        {"name": "Pool2","minSize": 2,"maxSize": 5,"enabled":true}
        ]
        ```
        {: codeblock}
        
        The cluster autoscaler can scale only worker pools that have the `ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/worker-pool-id` label. To check whether your worker pool has the required label, run `ibmcloud ks worker-pool get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool_name_or_ID> | grep Labels`. If your worker pool does not have the required label, add a new worker pool and use this worker pool with the cluster autoscaler.
        {: note}

    - `"minSize": 1`: Specify the minimum number of worker nodes per zone that the cluster autoscaler can scale down the worker pool to. The value must be `2` or greater so that your ALB pods can be spread for high availability. If you [disabled](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_alb_configure) all public ALBs in each zone of your standard cluster, you can set the value to `1`.

        Setting a `minSize` does not automatically trigger a scale-up. The `minSize` is a threshold so that the cluster autoscaler does not scale to fewer than a certain number of worker nodes per zone. If your cluster does not yet have that number per zone, the cluster autoscaler does not scale up until you have workload resource requests that require more resources. For example, if you have a worker pool with one worker node per three zones (three total worker nodes) and set the `minSize` to `4` per zone, the cluster autoscaler does not immediately provision an additional three worker nodes per zone (12 worker nodes total). Instead, the scale-up is triggered by resource requests. If you create a workload that requests the resources of 15 worker nodes, the cluster autoscaler scales up the worker pool to meet this request. Now, the `minSize` means that the cluster autoscaler does not scale down to fewer than four worker nodes per zone even if you remove the workload that requests the amount. For more information, see the [Kubernetes docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#when-does-cluster-autoscaler-change-the-size-of-a-cluster){: external}.
        {: note}

    - `"maxSize": 2`: Specify the maximum number of worker nodes per zone that the cluster autoscaler can scale up the worker pool to. The value must be equal to or greater than the value that you set for the `minSize`.
    - `"enabled": false`: Set the value to `true` for the cluster autoscaler to manage scaling for the worker pool. Set the value to `false` to stop the cluster autoscaler from scaling the worker pool. Later, if you want to [remove the cluster autoscaler](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-install-addon&interface=ui#autoscaler-remove-console), you must first disable each worker pool in the ConfigMap.

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Get your cluster autoscaler pod.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Review the **`Events`** section of the cluster autoscaler pod for a **`ConfigUpdated`** event to verify that the ConfigMap is successfully updated. The event message for your ConfigMap is in the following format: `minSize:maxSize:PoolName:<SUCCESS|FAILED>:error message`.

    ```sh
    kubectl describe pod -n kube-system <cluster_autoscaler_pod>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
        Name:               ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler-857c4d9d54-gwvc6
        Namespace:          kube-system
        ...
        Events:
        Type     Reason         Age   From                                        Message
        ----     ------         ----  ----                                        -------

        Normal  ConfigUpdated  3m    ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler-857c4d9d54-gwvc6  {"1:3:default":"SUCCESS:"}
    ```
    {: screen}


If you enable a worker pool for autoscaling and then later add a zone to this worker pool, restart the cluster autoscaler pod so that it picks up this change: `kubectl delete pod -n kube-system <cluster_autoscaler_pod>`.
{: note}

## Customizing the cluster autoscaler configuration values
{: #ca_customize}


Customize the cluster autoscaler settings such as the amount of time it waits before scaling worker nodes up or down.

1. Review the [cluster autoscaler ConfigMap](#ca-configmap) parameters.

1. Download the cluster autoscaler add-on ConfigMap and review the parameters.

    ```sh
    kubectl get cm iks-ca-configmap -n kube-system -o yaml > configmap.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Open the `configmap.yaml` file and update the settings that you want to change.

1. Reapply the cluster autoscaler add-on configmap.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pods are restarted successfully.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep autoscaler
    ```

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `expander` | How the cluster autoscaler determines which worker pool to scale if you have multiple worker pools.  \n - `random`: Selects randomly between `most-pods` and `least-waste`.  \n - `most-pods`: Selects the worker pool that is able to schedule the most pods when scaling up. Use this method if you are using `nodeSelector` to make sure that pods land on specific worker nodes.  \n - `least-waste`: Selects the worker pool that has the least unused CPU after scaling up. If two worker pools use the same amount of CPU resources after scaling up, the worker pool with the least unused memory is selected. | `random` |
| `prometheusScrape` | Set to `true` to send Prometheus metrics. To stop sending metrics, set to `false`. | `true` |
| `ignoreDaemonSetsUtilization` | Ignores autoscaler DaemonSet pods when calculating resource utilization for scale-down. | `false` |
| `imagePullPolicy` | When to pull the Docker image.  \n - `Always`: Pulls the image every time that the pod is started.  \n - `IfNotPresent`: Pulls the image only if the image isn't already present locally.  \n - `Never`: Assumes that the image exists locally and never pulls the image. | `Always` |
| `livenessProbeFailureThreshold` | The number of times that the `kubelet` retries a liveness probe after the pod starts and the first liveness probe fails.

| `scaleDownCandidatesPoolRatio` | The ratio of nodes that are considered as additional non-empty candidates for scale down when some candidates from previous iteration are no longer valid. | `0.1` |
| `scaleDownCandidatesPoolMinCount` | The minimum number of nodes that are considered as additional non-empty candidates for scale down when some candidates from previous iterations are no longer valid. | `50` |
| `scaleDownEnabled` | When set to `false`, the autoscaler does not perform scale down. | `true` |
| `scaleDownUnreadyEnabled` | When set to `true` unready nodes are scheduled for scale down. | `true` |
| `scanInterval` | Set how often in minutes that the cluster autoscaler scans for workload usage that triggers scaling up or down. | `1m` |
| `skipNodesWithLocalStorage` | When set to `true`, worker nodes that have pods that are saving data to local storage are not scaled down. The default value is `true` |
| `skipNodesWithSystemPods` | When set to `true`, worker nodes that have `kube-system` pods are not scaled down. Do not set the value to `false` because scaling down `kube-system` pods might have unexpected results. | `true` |
| `expendablePodsPriorityCutoff` | Pods with priority under the cutoff are expendable. They can be removed without consideration during scale down and they don't cause scale up. Pods that `PodPriority` set to null are not expendable. | `-10` |
| `minReplicaCount` | The minimum number of replicas that a replicaSet or replication controller must allow to be deleted during scale down. | `0` |
| `maxPodEvictionTime` | Maximum time the autoscaler tries to evict a pod before stopping. | `2m` | 
| `newPodScaleUpDelay` | Pods newer than this value in seconds are not considered for scale-up. Can be increased for individual pods through the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/pod-scale-up-delay` annotation. | `0s` |
| `balancingIgnoreLabel` | The node label key to ignore during zone balancing. Apart from the fixed node labels, the autoscaler can ignore an additional 5 node labels during zone balancing. For example, `balancingIgnoreLabel1:label1`, `balancingIgnoreLabel2: custom-label2`. |
| `workerPoolsConfig.json` | The worker pools that you want to autoscale, including their minimum and maximum number of worker nodes per zone.  \n - `{"name": "<pool_name>","minSize": 1,"maxSize": 2,"enabled":false}`.  \n - `<pool_name>`: The name or ID of the worker pool that you want to enable or disable for autoscaling. To list available worker pools, run `ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`  \n - `maxSize: <number_of_workers>`: The maximum number of worker nodes per zone that the cluster autoscaler can scale up to. The value must be equal to or greater than the value that you set for the `minSize: <number_of_workers>` size.  \n - `min=<number_of_workers>`: The minimum number of worker nodes per zone that the cluster autoscaler can scale down to. The value must be `2` or greater so that your ALB pods can be spread for high availability. If you [disabled](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_alb_configure) all public ALBs in each zone of your standard cluster, you can set the value to `1`. Keep in mind that setting a `min` size does not automatically trigger a scale-up. The `min` size is a threshold so that the cluster autoscaler does not scale to fewer than this minimum number of worker nodes per zone. If your cluster does not have this number of worker nodes per zone yet, the cluster autoscaler does not scale up until you have workload resource requests that require more resources.  \n - `enabled=`: When `true`, the cluster autoscaler can scale your worker pool. When `false`, the cluster autoscaler won't scale the worker pool. Later, if you want to remove the cluster autoscaler, you must first disable each worker pool in the ConfigMap. If you enable a worker pool for autoscaling and then later add a zone to this worker pool, restart the cluster autoscaler pod so that it picks up this change: `kubectl delete pod -n kube-system <cluster_autoscaler_pod>`. | By default, the `default` worker pool is **not** enabled, with a `max` value of `2` and a `min` value of `1` |
