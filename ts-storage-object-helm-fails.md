# Why does installing the Object storage `ibmc` Helm plug-in fail?
{: #cos_helm_fails}
{: support}

Supported infrastructure providers
:   Classic
:   VPC


When you install the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} `ibmc` Helm plug-in, the installation fails with one of the following errors:
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
Error: symlink /Users/iks-charts/ibm-object-storage-plugin/helm-ibmc /Users/ibm/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc: file exists
```
{: screen}

```sh
Error: fork/exec /home/iksadmin/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh: permission denied
```
{: screen}


When the `ibmc` Helm plug-in is installed, a symlink is created from the `~/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc` directory for Linux systems or the `~/Library/helm/plugins/helm-ibmc` directory for Mac OS to the directory where the `ibmc` Helm plug-in is located on your local system, which is usually in `./ibmcloud-object-storage-plugin/helm-ibmc`.
{: tsCauses}

When you remove the `ibmc` Helm plug-in from your local system, or you move the `ibmc` Helm plug-in directory to a different location, the symlink is not removed.

If you see a `permission denied` error, you don't have the required `read`, `write`, and `execute` permission on the `ibmc.sh` bash file so that you can execute `ibmc` Helm plug-in commands.


Review the following steps based on the error type.
{: tsResolve}

**For symlink errors**:

1. Remove the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} Helm plug-in.
    **Linux**
    ```sh
    rm -rf ~/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Mac OS**
    ```sh
    rm -rf ~/Library/helm/plugins/helm-ibmc for macOS
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Follow the [documentation](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_install) to re-install the `ibmc` Helm plug-in and the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in.

**For permission errors**:

1. Change the permissions for the `ibmc` plug-in.
    **Linux**
    ```sh
    chmod 755 ~/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Mac OS**
    ```sh
    chmod 755 ~/Library/helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh
    ```

2. Try out the `ibm` Helm plug-in.
    ```sh
    helm ibmc --help
    ```
    {: pre}

3. [Continue installing the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_install).
