# Clusters and masters
{: #cs_troubleshoot}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for general troubleshooting and debugging your cluster and cluster master.
{: shortdesc}

**General ways to resolve issues**

1. Keep your cluster environment up to date.
   * Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).
   * [Update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master) to the latest default version for [{{site.data.keyword.containershort}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
2. Make sure that your command line tools are up to date.
   * In the command line, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up-to-date so that you can use all available commands and flags.
   * Make sure that [your `kubectl` CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).
<br>

**Reviewing issues and status**

1. To see whether {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is available, [check the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status){: external}.
2. Filter for the **Kubernetes Service** component.

## Running tests with the Diagnostics and Debug Tool
{: #debug_utility}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

While you troubleshoot, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} Diagnostics and Debug Tool to run tests and gather pertinent information from your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

**Infrastructure provider**:
  * <img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Classic
  * <img src="images/icon-vpc.png" alt="VPC infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> VPC Generation 1 compute
  * <img src="images/icon-vpc.png" alt="VPC infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> VPC Generation 2 compute

**Before you begin**:
If you previously installed the debug tool by using Helm, first uninstall the `ibmcloud-iks-debug` Helm chart.
1. Find the installation name of your Helm chart.
  ```
  helm list -n <namespace> | grep ibmcloud-iks-debug
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:
  ```
  <helm_chart_name> 1 Thu Sep 13 16:41:44 2019 DEPLOYED ibmcloud-iks-debug-1.0.0 default
  ```
  {: screen}

2. Uninstall the debug tool installation by deleting the Helm chart.
  ```
  helm uninstall <helm_chart_name> -n <namespace>
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Verify that the debug tool pods are removed. When the uninstallation is complete, no pods are returned by the following command.
  ```
  kubectl get pod --all-namespaces | grep ibmcloud-iks-debug
  ```
  {: pre}

</br>**To enable and use the Diagnostics and Debug Tool add-on:**

1. In your [cluster dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external}, click the name of the cluster where you want to install the debug tool add-on.

2. Click the **Add-ons** tab.

3. On the Diagnostics and Debug Tool card, click **Install**.

4. In the dialog box, click **Install**. Note that it can take a few minutes for the add-on to be installed. <p class="tip">To resolve some common issues that you might encounter during the add-on deployment, see [Reviewing add-on state and statuses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_addons#debug_addons).</p>

5. On the Diagnostics and Debug Tool card, click **Dashboard**.

6. In the debug tool dashboard, select individual tests or a group of tests to run. Some tests check for potential warnings, errors, or issues, and some tests only gather information that you can reference while you troubleshoot. For more information about the function of each test, click the information icon next to the test's name.

7. Click **Run**.

8. Check the results of each test.
  * If any test fails, click the information icon next to the test's name in the left column for information about how to resolve the issue.
  * You can also use the results of tests to gather information, such as complete YAMLs, that can help you debug your cluster in the following sections.

1.  List your cluster and find the `State` of the cluster.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks cluster ls
  ```
  {: pre}

2.  Review the `State` of your cluster. If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, start [debugging the worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#debug_worker_nodes).

    You can view the current cluster state by running the `ibmcloud ks cluster ls` command and locating the **State** field.

If a pod goes down during the master outage, the pod cannot be rescheduled until the worker node can reach the Kubernetes API server again.<br><br>During a master outage, you can still run `ibmcloud ks` commands against the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API to work with your infrastructure resources, such as worker nodes or VLANs. If you change the current cluster configuration by adding or removing worker nodes to the cluster, your changes do not happen until the master is back up.</p>
<p class="important">Do not restart or reboot a worker node during a master outage. This action removes the pods from your worker node. Because the Kubernetes API server is unavailable, the pods cannot be rescheduled onto other worker nodes in the cluster.</p>

**Infrastructure provider**:
  * <img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Classic
  * <img src="images/icon-vpc.png" alt="VPC infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> VPC Generation 1 compute

Your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} includes an IBM-managed master with highly available replicas, automatic security patch updates applied for you, and automation in place to recover in case of an incident. You can check the health, status, and state of the cluster master by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.
{: shortdesc}

**Master Health**

The **Master Health** reflects the state of master components and notifies you if something needs your attention. The health might be one of the following:
*   `error`: The master is not operational. IBM is automatically notified and takes action to resolve this issue. You can continue monitoring the health until the master is `normal`. You can also [open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case](/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help).
*   `normal`: The master is operational and healthy. No action is required.
*   `unavailable`: The master might not be accessible, which means some actions such as resizing a worker pool are temporarily unavailable. IBM is automatically notified and takes action to resolve this issue. You can continue monitoring the health until the master is `normal`.
*   `unsupported`: The master runs an unsupported version of Kubernetes. You must [update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update) to return the master to `normal` health.

**Master Status and State**

The **Master Status** provides details of what operation from the master state is in progress. The status includes a timestamp of how long the master has been in the same state, such as `Ready (1 month ago)`. The **Master State** reflects the lifecycle of possible operations that can be performed on the master, such as deploying, updating, and deleting. Each state is described in the following table.

|Master state|Description|
|--- |--- |
|`deployed`|The master is successfully deployed. Check the status to verify that the master is `Ready` or to see if an update is available.|
|`deploying`|The master is currently deploying. Wait for the state to become `deployed` before working with your cluster, such as adding worker nodes.|
|`deploy_failed`|The master failed to deploy. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. Check the **Master Status** field for more information, or wait for the state to become `deployed`.|
|`deleting`|The master is currently deleting because you deleted the cluster. You cannot undo a deletion. After the cluster is deleted, you can no longer check the master state because the cluster is completely removed.|
|`delete_failed`|The master failed to delete. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You cannot resolve the issue by trying to delete the cluster again. Instead, check the **Master Status** field for more information, or wait for the cluster to delete. You can also [open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case](/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help).|
|`updating`|The master is updating its Kubernetes version. The update might be a patch update that is automatically applied, or a minor or major version that you applied by updating the cluster. During the update, your highly available master can continue processing requests, and your app workloads and worker nodes continue to run. After the master update is complete, you can [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).</br></br>If the update is unsuccessful, the master returns to a `deployed` state and continues running the previous version. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can check if the update failed in the **Master Status** field.|
|`update_cancelled`|The master update is canceled because the cluster was not in a healthy state at the time of the update. Your master remains in this state until your cluster is healthy and you manually update the master. To update the master, use the `ibmcloud ks cluster master update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update).If you do not want to update the master to the default `major.minor` version during the update, include the `--version` flag and specify the latest patch version that is available for the `major.minor` version that you want, such as `1.18.15`. To list available versions, run `ibmcloud ks versions`.|
|`update_failed`|The master update failed. IBM Support is notified and works to resolve the issue. You can continue to monitor the health of the master until the master reaches a normal state. If the master remains in this state for more than 1 day, [open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case](/docs/containers?topic=containers-get-help). IBM Support might identify other issues in your cluster that you must fix before the master can be updated.|

### Firewall prevents running CLI commands
{: #ts_firewall_clis}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you run `ibmcloud`, `kubectl`, or `calicoctl` commands from the CLI, they fail.

{: tsCauses}
You might have corporate network policies that prevent access from your local system to public endpoints via proxies or firewalls.

{: tsResolve}
[Allow TCP access for the CLI commands to work](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#firewall_bx). This task requires the [**Administrator** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for the cluster.

<br />

### `kubectl` commands do not work
{: #kubectl_fails}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you run `kubectl` commands against your cluster, your commands fail with an error message similar to the following.

```
No resources found.
Error from server (NotAcceptable): unknown (get nodes)
```
{: screen}

```
invalid object doesn't have additional properties
```
{: screen}

```
error: No Auth Provider found for name "oidc"
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
You have a different version of `kubectl` than your cluster version. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2). If you use a community Kubernetes cluster, you might also have the {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} version of `kubectl`, which does not work with community Kubernetes clusters.

To check your client `kubectl` version against the cluster server version, run `kubectl version --short`.

{: tsResolve}
[Install the version of `kubectl`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) that matches the Kubernetes version of your cluster.

If you have multiple clusters at different Kubernetes versions or different container platforms such as {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}}, download each `kubectl` version binary file to a separate directory. Then, you can set up an alias in your local command-line interface (CLI) profile to point to the `kubectl` binary file directory that matches the `kubectl` version of the cluster that you want to work with, or you might be able to use a tool such as `brew switch kubernetes-cli <major.minor>`.

<br />


### `kubectl` commands time out
{: #exec_logs_fail}

{: tsSymptoms}
If you run commands such as `kubectl exec`, `kubectl attach`, `kubectl proxy`, `kubectl port-forward`, or `kubectl logs`, you see the following message.

  ```
  <workerIP>:10250: getsockopt: connection timed out
  ```
  {: screen}

{: tsCauses}
The OpenVPN connection between the master node and worker nodes is not functioning properly.

{: tsResolve}
1. In classic clusters, if you have multiple VLANs for your cluster, multiple subnets on the same VLAN, or a multizone classic cluster, you must enable a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#vrf) for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account so your worker nodes can communicate with each other on the private network. To enable VRF, see [Enabling VRF](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#vrf). To check whether a VRF is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud account show` command. If you cannot or do not want to enable VRF, enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning). To perform this action, you need the **Network > Manage Network VLAN Spanning** [infrastructure permission](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#infra_access), or you can request the account owner to enable it. To check whether VLAN spanning is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud ks vlan spanning get --region <region>` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_vlan_spanning_get).
2. Restart the OpenVPN client pod.
  ```
  kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l app=vpn
  ```
  {: pre}
3. If you still see the same error message, then the worker node that the VPN pod is on might be unhealthy. To restart the VPN pod and reschedule it to a different worker node, [cordon, drain, and reboot the worker node](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reboot) that the VPN pod is on.

<br />


<br />

## Unable to create or delete worker nodes or clusters
{: #infra_errors}

You cannot perform infrastructure-related commands on your cluster, such as:
* Adding worker nodes in an existing cluster or when creating a new cluster
* Removing worker nodes
* Reloading or rebooting worker nodes
* Resizing worker pools
* Updating your cluster
* Deleting your cluster

{: tsCauses}
The infrastructure credentials that are set for the region and resource group are missing the appropriate [infrastructure permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference#infra). The user's infrastructure permissions are most commonly stored as an [API key](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#api_key) for the region and resource group. More rarely, if you use a [different {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account type](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#understand_infra), you might have [set infrastructure credentials manually](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#credentials).

{: tsResolve}
The account owner must set up the infrastructure account credentials properly. The credentials depend on what type of infrastructure account you are using.

Before you begin, [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure).

1.  Identify what user credentials are used for the region and resource group's infrastructure permissions.
    1.  Check the API key for a region and resource group of the cluster.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks api-key info --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        Getting information about the API key owner for cluster <cluster_name>...
        OK
        Name                Email
        <user_name>         <name@email.com>
        ```
        {: screen}
    2.  Check if the classic infrastructure account for the region and resource group is manually set to use a different IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks credential get --region <us-south>
        ```
        {: pre}

        **Example output if credentials are set to use a different classic account**. In this case, the user's infrastructure credentials are used for the region and resource group that you targeted, even if a different user's credentials are stored in the API key that you retrieved in the previous step.
        ```
        OK
        Infrastructure credentials for user name <1234567_name@email.com> set for resource group <resource_group_name>.
        ```
        {: screen}

        **Example output if credentials are not set to use a different classic account**. In this case, the API key owner that you retrieved in the previous step has the infrastructure credentials that are used for the region and resource group.
        ```
        FAILED
        No credentials set for resource group <resource_group_name>.: The user credentials could not be found. (E0051)
        ```
        {: screen}
2.  Validate the infrastructure permissions that the user has.
    1.  List the suggested and required infrastructure permissions for the region and resource group.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks infra-permissions get --region <region>
        ```
        {: pre}

        For console and CLI commands to assign these permissions, see [Classic infrastructure roles](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference#infra).
        {: tip}
    2.  Make sure that the [infrastructure credentials owner for the API key or the manually-set account has the correct permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#owner_permissions).
    3.  If necessary, you can change the [API key](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_api_key_reset) or [manually-set](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_set) infrastructure credentials owner for the region and resource group.
3.  Test that the changed permissions permit authorized users to perform infrastructure operations for the cluster.
    1.  For example, you might try to a delete a worker node.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker rm --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  Check to see if the worker node is removed.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_node_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output if the worker node removal is successful. The `worker get` operation fails because the worker node is deleted. The infrastructure permissions are correctly set up.
        ```
        FAILED
        The specified worker node could not be found. (E0011)
        ```
        {: screen}

    3.  If the worker node is not removed, review that [**State** and **Status** fields](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#debug_worker_nodes) and the [common issues with worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#common_worker_nodes_issues) to continue debugging.
    4.  If you manually set credentials and still cannot see the cluster's worker nodes in your infrastructure account, you might check whether the [cluster is orphaned](#orphaned).

### Unable to create or delete worker nodes due to incorrect account error
{: #orphaned}

**Infrastructure provider**: <img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Classic

{: tsSymptoms}
You cannot manage worker nodes for your cluster, or view the cluster worker nodes in your classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account. However, you can update and manage other clusters in the account.

Further, you verified that you have the [proper infrastructure credentials](#cs_credentials).

You might receive an error message in your worker node status similar to the following.
```
Incorrect account for worker - The 'classic' infrastructure user credentials changed and no longer match the worker node instance infrastructure account.
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
The cluster might be provisioned in a classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account that is no longer linked to your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} account. The cluster is orphaned. Because the resources are in a different account, you do not have the infrastructure credentials to modify the resources.

Consider the following example scenario to understand how clusters might become orphaned.
1.  You have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay-As-You-Go account.
2.  You create a cluster named `Cluster1`. The worker nodes and other infrastructure resources are provisioned into the infrastructure account that comes with your Pay-As-You-Go account.
3.  Later, you find out that your team uses a legacy or shared classic IBM Cloud infrastructure account. You use the `ibmcloud ks credential set` command to change the IBM Cloud infrastructure credentials to use your team account.
4.  You create another cluster named `Cluster2`. The worker nodes and other infrastructure resources are provisioned into the team infrastructure account.
5.  You notice that `Cluster1` needs a worker node update, a worker node reload, or you just want to clean it up by deleting it. However, because `Cluster1` was provisioned into a different infrastructure account, you cannot modify its infrastructure resources. `Cluster1` is orphaned.
6.  You follow the resolution steps in the following section, but do not set your infrastructure credentials back to your team account. You can delete `Cluster1`, but now `Cluster2` is orphaned.
7.  You change your infrastructure credentials back to the team account that created `Cluster2`. Now, you no longer have an orphaned cluster!

<br>

{: tsResolve}
1.  Check which infrastructure account the region that your cluster is in currently uses to provision clusters. Replace `<region>` with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region that the cluster is in.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks credential get --region <region>
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you see a message similar to the following, then the account uses the default, linked infrastructure account.
    ```
    No credentials set for resource group <resource group>.: The user credentials could not be found.
    ```
    {: screen}
2.  Check which infrastructure account was used to provision the cluster.
    1.  In the **Worker Nodes** tab, select a worker node and note its **ID**.
    2.  Open the menu ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu icon") and click **Classic Infrastructure**.
    3.  From the infrastructure navigation pane, click **Devices > Device List**.
    4.  Search for the worker node ID that you previously noted.
    5.  If you do not find the worker node ID, the worker node is not provisioned into this infrastructure account. Switch to a different infrastructure account and try again.
3.  Compare the infrastructure accounts.
    *   **If the worker nodes are in the linked infrastructure account**: Use the `ibmcloud ks credential unset` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_unset) to resume using the default infrastructure credentials that are linked with your Pay-As-You-Go account.
    *   **If the worker nodes are in a different infrastructure account**: Use the `ibmcloud ks credential set` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_set) to change your infrastructure credentials to the account that the cluster worker nodes are provisioned in, which you found in the previous step.

        If you no longer have access to the infrastructure credentials, you can open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case to determine an email address for the administrator of the other infrastructure account. However, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support cannot remove the orphaned cluster for you, and you must contact the administrator of the other account to get the infrastructure credentials.
        {: note}
    *   **If the infrastructure accounts match**: Check the rest of the worker nodes in the cluster and see if any has a different infrastructure account. Make sure that you checked the worker nodes in the cluster that has the credentials issue. Review other [common infrastructure credential issues](#infra_errors).
4.  Now that the infrastructure credentials are updated, retry the blocked action, such as updating or deleting a worker node, and verify that the action succeeds.
5.  If you have other clusters in the same region and resource that require the previous infrastructure credentials, repeat Step 3 to reset the infrastructure credentials to the previous account. Note that if you created clusters with a different infrastructure account than the account that you switch to, you might orphan those clusters.

    Tired of switching infrastructure accounts each time you need to perform a cluster or worker action? Consider re-creating all the clusters in the region and resource group in the same infrastructure account. Then, migrate your workloads and remove the old clusters from the different infrastructure account.

You cannot manage worker nodes for your cluster, and you receive an error message similar to one of the following.
```
Unable to connect to the IBM Cloud account. Ensure that you have a paid account.
```
{: screen}
```
Cannot authenticate the infrastructure user: Time-based One Time Password authentication is required to log in with this user.
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account uses its own automatically linked infrastructure through a Pay-as-you-Go account. However, the account administrator enabled the time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) option so that users are prompted for a time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) at login. This type of [multifactor authentication (MFA)](/docs/account?topic=account-types#account-based) is account-based, and affects all access to the account. TOTP MFA also affects the access that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} requires to make calls to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure. If TOTP is enabled for the account, you cannot create and manage clusters and worker nodes in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.

{: tsResolve}
The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account owner or an account administrator must either:
* Disable TOTP for the account, and continue to use the automatically linked infrastructure credentials for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.
* Continue to use TOTP, but create an infrastructure API key that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} can use to make direct calls to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure API.

**To disable TOTP MFA for the account:**
1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}. From the menu bar, select **Manage > Access (IAM)**.
2. In the left navigation, click the **Settings** page.
3. Under **Multifactor authentication**, click **Edit**.
4. Select **None**, and click **Update**.

**To use TOTP MFA and create an infrastructure API key for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}:**
1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} console, select **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** > **Users** and click the name of the account owner. **Note**: If you do not use the account owner's credentials, first [ensure that the user whose credentials you use has the correct permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#owner_permissions).
2. In the **API Keys** section, find or create a classic infrastructure API key.
3. Use the infrastructure API key to set the infrastructure API credentials for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. Repeat this command for each region where you create clusters.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks credential set classic --infrastructure-username <infrastructure_API_username> --infrastructure-api-key <infrastructure_API_authentication_key> --region <region>
    ```
    {: pre}
4. Verify that the correct credentials are set.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks credential get --region <region>
    ```
    {: pre}
    Example output:
    ```
    Infrastructure credentials for user name user@email.com set for resource group default.
    ```
    {: screen}
5. To ensure that existing clusters use the updated infrastructure API credentials, run `ibmcloud ks api-key reset --region <region>` in each region where you have clusters.

{: tsCauses}
During cluster creation, the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} console uses the API key that is set for the `default` resource group to list the VPCs that are available in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If no API key is set for the `default` resource group, no VPCs are listed in the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} console, even if your VPC exists in a different resource group and an API key is set for that resource group.

{: tsResolve}
To set an API key for the `default` resource group, use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} CLI.
1. Log in to the command line as the account owner. If you want a different user than the account owner to set the API key, first [ensure that the API key owner has the correct permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#owner_permissions).

{: tsSymptoms}
During a master operation such as updating your cluster version, the cluster had a broken webhook application. Now, master operations cannot complete. You see an error similar to the following:

```
Cannot complete cluster master operations because the cluster has a broken webhook application. For more information, see the troubleshooting docs: 'https://ibm.biz/master_webhook'
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
Your cluster has configurable Kubernetes webhook resources, validating or mutating admission webhooks, that can intercept and modify requests from various services in the cluster to the API server in the cluster master. Because webhooks can change or reject requests, broken webhooks can impact the functionality of the cluster in various ways, such as preventing you from updating the master version or other maintenance operations. For more information, see the [Dynamic Admission Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/){: external} in the Kubernetes documentation.

Potential causes for broken webhooks include:
*   The underlying resource that issues the request is missing or unhealthy, such as a Kubernetes service, endpoint, or pod.
*   The webhook is part of an add-on or other plug-in application that did not install correctly or is unhealthy.
*   Your cluster might have a networking connectivity issue that prevents the webhook from communicating with the Kubernetes API server in the cluster master.

{: tsResolve}
Identify and restore the resource that causes the broken webhook.

1.  Create a test pod to get an error that identifies the broken webhook. The error message might have the name of the broken webhook.
    ```
    kubectl run webhook-test --generator=run-pod/v1 --image pause:latest
    ```
    {: pre}

    In the following example, the webhook is `trust.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com`.
    ```
    Error from server (InternalError): Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "trust.hooks.securityenforcementadmission.cloud.ibm.com": Post https://ibmcloud-image-enforcement.ibm-system.svc:443/mutating-pods?timeout=30s: dialtcp 172.21.xxx.xxx:443: connect: connection timed out
    ```
    {: screen}
2.  Get the name of the broken webhook.
    *   If the error message has a broken webhook, replace `trust.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com` with the broken webhook that you previously identified.
        ```
        kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations,validatingwebhookconfigurations -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.webhooks[*].name=="trust.hooks.securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com")].metadata.name}{"\n"}'
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        image-admission-config
        ```
        {: pre}
    *   If the error does not have a broken webhook, list all the webhooks in your cluster and check their configurations in the following steps.
        ```
        kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations,validatingwebhookconfigurations
        ```
        {: pre}   
3.  Review the service and location details of the mutating or validating webhook configuration in the `clientConfig` section in the output of the following command. Replace `image-admission-config` with the name that you previously identified. If the webhook exists outside the cluster, contact the cluster owner to check the webhook status.
    ```
    kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration image-admission-config -o yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations image-admission-config -o yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
      clientConfig:
        caBundle: <redacted>
        service:
            name: <name>
            namespace: <namespace>
            path: /inject
            port: 443
    ```
    {: screen}
4.  **Optional**: Back up the webhooks, especially if you do not know how to reinstall the webhook.
    ```
    kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration <name> -o yaml > mutatingwebhook-backup.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    kubectl get validatingwebhookconfiguration <name> -o yaml > validatingwebhook-backup.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}
5.  Check the status of the related service and pods for the webhook.
    1.  Check the service **Type**, **Selector**, and **Endpoint** fields.
        ```
        kubectl describe service -n <namespace> <service_name>
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  If the service type is **ClusterIP**, check that the OpenVPN pod is in a **Running** status so that the webhook can connect securely to the Kubernetes API in the cluster master. If the pod is not healthy, check the pod events, logs, worker node health, and other components to troubleshoot. For more information, see [Debugging app deployments](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_app).
        ```
        kubectl describe pods -n kube-system -l app=vpn
        ```
        {: pre}
    3.  If the service does not have an endpoint, check the health of the backing resources, such as a deployment or pod. If the resource is not healthy, check the pod events, logs, worker node health, and other components to troubleshoot. For more information, see [Debugging app deployments](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_app).
        ```
        kubectl get all -n my-service-namespace -l <key=value>
        ```
        {: pre}
    4.  If the service does not have any backing resources, or if troubleshooting the pods does not resolve the issue, remove the webhook.
        ```
        kubectl delete mutatingwebhook <name>
        ```
        {: pre}
6.  Retry the cluster master operation, such as updating the cluster.
7.  If you still see the error, you might have worker node or network connectivity issues.
    *   [Worker node troubleshooting](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters).
    *   Make sure that the webhook can connect to the Kubernetes API server in the cluster master. For example, if you use Calico network policies, security groups, or some other type of firewall, set up your [classic](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall) or [VPC](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-firewall) cluster with the appropriate access.
    *   If the webhook is managed by an add-on that you installed, uninstall the add-on. Common add-ons that cause webhook issues include the following:
        * [Portieris](https://github.com/IBM/portieris){: external}.
        * [Istio](/docs/containers?topic=containers-istio#istio_uninstall).
8.  Re-create the webhook or reinstall the add-on.

    *   Check if you have an existing Portieris deployment in your cluster. If no output is returned, you do not have the deployment.
        ```
        kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces -l app=portieries
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        NAMESPACE     NAME        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
        portieris     portieris   3/3     3            3           8m8s
        ```
        {: pre}
2.  Uninstall the conflicting deployment.
    *   For container image security enforcement, see the [{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-security_enforce#remove).
    *   For Portieris, see the [open source documentation](https://github.com/IBM/portieris#uninstalling-portieris){: external}.
3.  Confirm that conflicting admission controllers are removed by checking that the cluster no longer has a mutating webhook configuration for an image admission controller.
    ```
    kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-admission-config
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    Error from server (NotFound): mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io "image-admission-config" not found
    ```
    {: pre}
4.  Retry the installing the add-on by running the `ibmcloud ks cluster image-security enable` command.

{: tsSymptoms}
When you deploy your cluster, it remains in a pending state and doesn't start.

{: tsCauses}
If you just created the cluster, the worker nodes might still be configuring. If you already wait for a while, you might have an invalid VLAN.

{: tsResolve}

You can try one of the following solutions:
  - Check the status of your cluster by running `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`. Then, check to be sure that your worker nodes are deployed by running `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name>`.
  - Check to see whether your VLAN is valid. To be valid, a VLAN must be associated with infrastructure that can host a worker with local disk storage. You can [list your VLANs](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_vlans) by running `ibmcloud ks vlan ls --zone <zone>` if the VLAN does not show in the list, then it is not valid. Choose a different VLAN.

## Unable to view or work with a cluster

{: tsSymptoms}
* You are not able to find a cluster. When you run `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`, the cluster is not listed in the output.
* You are not able to work with a cluster. When you run `ibmcloud ks cluster config` or other cluster-specific commands, the cluster is not found.


{: tsCauses}
In {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, each resource must be in a resource group. For example, cluster `mycluster` might exist in the `default` resource group. When the account owner gives you access to resources by assigning you an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role, the access can be to a specific resource or to the resource group. When you are given access to a specific resource, you don't have access to the resource group. In this case, you don't need to target a resource group to work with the clusters you have access to. If you target a different resource group than the group that the cluster is in, actions against that cluster can fail. Conversely, when you are given access to a resource as part of your access to a resource group, you must target a resource group to work with a cluster in that group. If you don't target your CLI session to the resource group that the cluster is in, actions against that cluster can fail.

If you cannot find or work with a cluster, you might be experiencing one of the following issues:
* You have access to the cluster and the resource group that the cluster is in, but your CLI session is not targeted to the resource group that the cluster is in.
* You have access to the cluster, but not as part of the resource group that the cluster is in. Your CLI session is targeted to this or another resource group.
* You don't have access to the cluster.

{: tsResolve}
To check your user access permissions:

1. List all of your user permissions.
    ```
    ibmcloud iam user-policies <your_user_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Check if you have access to the cluster and to the resource group that the cluster is in.
    1. Look for a policy that has a **Resource Group Name** value of the cluster's resource group and a **Memo** value of `Policy applies to the resource group`. If you have this policy, you have access to the resource group. For example, this policy indicates that a user has access to the `test-rg` resource group:
        ```
        Policy ID:   3ec2c069-fc64-4916-af9e-e6f318e2a16c
        Roles:       Viewer
        Resources:
                     Resource Group ID     50c9b81c983e438b8e42b2e8eca04065
                     Resource Group Name   test-rg
                     Memo                  Policy applies to the resource group
        ```
        {: screen}
    2. Look for a policy that has a **Resource Group Name** value of the cluster's resource group, a **Service Name** value of `containers-kubernetes` or no value, and a **Memo** value of `Policy applies to the resource(s) within the resource group`. If you this policy, you have access to clusters or to all resources within the resource group. For example, this policy indicates that a user has access to clusters in the `test-rg` resource group:
        ```
        Policy ID:   e0ad889d-56ba-416c-89ae-a03f3cd8eeea
        Roles:       Administrator
        Resources:
                     Resource Group ID     a8a12accd63b437bbd6d58fb6a462ca7
                     Resource Group Name   test-rg
                     Service Name          containers-kubernetes
                     Service Instance
                     Region
                     Resource Type
                     Resource
                     Memo                  Policy applies to the resource(s) within the resource group
        ```
        {: screen}
    3. If you have both of these policies, skip to Step 4, first bullet. If you don't have the policy from Step 2a, but you do have the policy from Step 2b, skip to Step 4, second bullet. If you do not have either of these policies, continue to Step 3.

3. Check if you have access to the cluster, but not as part of access to the resource group that the cluster is in.
    1. Look for a policy that has no values besides the **Policy ID** and **Roles** fields. If you have this policy, you have access to the cluster as part of access to the entire account. For example, this policy indicates that a user has access to all resources in the account:
        ```
        Policy ID:   8898bdfd-d520-49a7-85f8-c0d382c4934e
        Roles:       Administrator, Manager
        Resources:
                     Service Name
                     Service Instance
                     Region
                     Resource Type
                     Resource
        ```
        {: screen}
    2. Look for a policy that has a **Service Name** value of `containers-kubernetes` and a **Service Instance** value of the cluster's ID. You can find a cluster ID by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name>`. For example, this policy indicates that a user has access to a specific cluster:
        ```
        Policy ID:   140555ce-93ac-4fb2-b15d-6ad726795d90
        Roles:       Administrator
        Resources:
                     Service Name       containers-kubernetes
                     Service Instance   df253b6025d64944ab99ed63bb4567b6
                     Region
                     Resource Type
                     Resource
        ```
        {: screen}
    3. If you have either of these policies, skip to the second bullet point of step 4. If you do not have either of these policies, skip to the third bullet point of step 4.

4. Depending on your access policies, choose one of the following options.
    * If you have access to the cluster and to the resource group that the cluster is in:
      1. Target the resource group. **Note**: You can't work with clusters in other resource groups until you untarget this resource group.
          ```
          ibmcloud target -g <resource_group>
          ```
          {: pre}

      2. Target the cluster.
          ```
          ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
          ```
          {: pre}

    * If you have access to the cluster but not to the resource group that the cluster is in:
      1. Do not target a resource group. If you already targeted a resource group, untarget it:
        ```
        ibmcloud target --unset-resource-group
        ```
        {: pre}

      2. Target the cluster.
        ```
        ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

    * If you do not have access to the cluster:
        1. Ask your account owner to assign an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) to you for that cluster.
        2. Do not target a resource group. If you already targeted a resource group, untarget it:
          ```
          ibmcloud target --unset-resource-group
          ```
          {: pre}
        3. Target the cluster.
          ```
          ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
          ```
          {: pre}

## Cannot access resources in a cluster
{: #cs_firewall}

**Infrastructure provider**: <img src="images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Classic

{: tsSymptoms}
When the worker nodes in your cluster cannot communicate on the private network, you might see various different symptoms.

- Sample error message when you run `kubectl exec`, `attach`, `logs`, `proxy`, or `port-forward`:
  ```
  Error from server: error dialing backend: dial tcp XXX.XXX.XXX:10250: getsockopt: connection timed out
  ```
  {: screen}

- Sample error message when `kubectl proxy` succeeds, but the Kubernetes dashboard is not available:
  ```
  timeout on 172.xxx.xxx.xxx
  ```
  {: screen}

- Sample error message when `kubectl proxy` fails or the connection to your service fails:
  ```
  Connection refused
  ```
  {: screen}

  ```
  Connection timed out
  ```
  {: screen}

  ```
  Unable to connect to the server: net/http: TLS handshake timeout
  ```
  {: screen}


{: tsCauses}
To access resources in the cluster, your worker nodes must be able to communicate on the private network. You might have a Vyatta or another firewall set up, or customized your existing firewall settings in your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} requires certain IP addresses and ports to be opened to allow communication from the worker node to the Kubernetes master and vice versa. If your worker nodes are spread across multiple zones, you must allow private network communication by enabling VLAN spanning. Communication between worker nodes might also not be possible if your worker nodes are stuck in a reloading loop.

{: tsResolve}
1. List the worker nodes in your cluster and verify that your worker nodes are not stuck in a `Reloading` state.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. If you have a multizone cluster and your account is not enabled for VRF, verify that you [enabled VLAN spanning](/docs/containers?topic=containers-subnets#subnet-routing) for your account.
3. If you have a Vyatta or custom firewall settings, make sure that you [opened up the required ports](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#firewall_outbound) to allow the cluster to access infrastructure resources and services.
