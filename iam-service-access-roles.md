# IAM service access roles
{: #iam-service-access-roles}

Every user who is assigned an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM service access role is also automatically assigned a corresponding Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) role in a specific namespace. To assign service access roles, see [Granting users access to your cluster through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#checking-perms). Do not assign {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform access roles at the same time as a service access role. You must assign platform and service access roles separately.
{: shortdesc}

Looking for which Kubernetes actions each service access role grants through RBAC? See [Kubernetes resource permissions per RBAC role](#rbac_ref). To learn more about RBAC roles, see [Assigning RBAC permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access-overview#role-binding) and [Extending existing permissions by aggregating cluster roles](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#rbac_aggregate). For the username details, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM issuer details for RBAC users](#iam-issuer-users).
{: tip}

The following table shows the Kubernetes resource permissions that are granted by each service access role and its corresponding RBAC role.


| Service access role| Corresponding RBAC role, binding, and scope | Kubernetes resource permissions |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Reader role | When scoped to one namespace: **`view`** cluster role applied by the **`ibm-view`** role binding in that namespace. \n - When scoped to all namespaces: **`view`** cluster role applied by the **`ibm-view`** role binding in each namespace of the cluster. You can also view the cluster in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console and CLI. | - Read access to resources in a namespace \n - No read access to roles and role bindings or to Kubernetes secrets \n - Access the Kubernetes dashboard to view resources in a namespace. |
| Writer role | When scoped to one namespace: **`edit`** cluster role applied by the **`ibm-edit`** role binding in that namespace. \n \n When scoped to all namespaces: **`edit`** cluster role applied by the **`ibm-edit`** role binding in each namespace of the cluster | - Read/write access to resources in a namespace \n - No read/write access to roles and role bindings< \n - Access the Kubernetes dashboard to view resources in a namespace. |

## Kubernetes resource permissions per RBAC role
{: #rbac_ref}

Every user who is assigned an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM service access role is also automatically assigned a corresponding, predefined Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) role. If you plan to manage your own custom Kubernetes RBAC roles, see [Creating custom RBAC permissions for users, groups, or service accounts](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#rbac). For the username details, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM issuer details for RBAC users](#iam-issuer-users).

Wondering if you have the correct permissions to run a certain `kubectl` command on a resource in a namespace? Try the [`kubectl auth can-i` command](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-can-i-em-){: external}.
{: tip}

The following table shows the permissions that are granted by each RBAC role to individual Kubernetes resources. Permissions are shown as which `verbs` (or actions) a user with that role can complete against the resource, such as "get", "list", "describe", "create", or "delete".

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM issuer details for RBAC users
{: #iam-issuer-users}

Users with a service access role to {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} in IAM are given [corresponding user roles in RBAC](#rbac_ref). The RBAC user details include a unique issuer ID, subject identifier claim, and Kubernetes username. These details vary with the Kubernetes version of the cluster. When you update a cluster from a previous version, the details are automatically updated. RBAC usernames are prefixed by `IAM#`. For more information about how OpenID authentication works, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

You might use this information if you build automation tooling within the cluster that relies on the user details to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server.

| Version | Issuer | Claim | Casing`*` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.18 or later | `https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity` | `realmed_sub_<account_ID>` | lowercase |
| 1.17 | `https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity` | `sub_<account_ID>` | lowercase |
| 1.10 - 1.16 | `https://iam.bluemix.net/identity` | `sub_<account_ID>` | lowercase |
| 1.9 or earlier | `https://iam.ng.bluemix.net/kubernetes` | `sub` | camel case |
{: summary="The rows are read from left to right. The first column is the Kubernetes version of the cluster. The second column is the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM Issuer ID. The third column is the subject identifier claim. The fourth column is the casing style of the username."}
{: caption="{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM issuer details for RBAC users" caption-side="bottom"}

`*`: An example of lowercase is `user.name@company.com`. An example of camel case is `User.Name@company.com`.
