# Why can't I SSH into my worker node?
{: #cs_ssh_worker}
{: support}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}


You can't access your worker node by using an SSH connection.
{: tsSymptoms}


SSH by password is unavailable on the worker nodes.
{: tsCauses}


To run actions on every worker node, use a Kubernetes [`DaemonSet`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/){: external}, or use jobs for one-time actions.
{: tsResolve}

To get host access to worker nodes for debugging and troubleshooting purposes, review the following options.

## Debugging by using `kubectl debug`
{: #oc-debug}

Use the `kubectl debug node` command to deploy a pod with a privileged `securityContext` to a worker node that you want to troubleshoot.
{: shortdesc}

The debug pod is deployed with an interactive shell so that you can access the worker node immediately after the pod is created. For more information about how the `kubectl debug node` command works, see [**`debug`** command in Kubernetes reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#debug){: external}{: external}.

1. Get the name of the worker node that you want to access. The worker node name is its private IP address.
    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Create a debug pod that has host access. When the pod is created, the pod's interactive shell is automatically opened. If the `kubectl debug node` command fails, continue to option 2. The Docker alpine image here is used as an example. If the worker node doesn't have public network access, you can maintain a copy of the image for debugging in your own ICR repository or build a customized image with other tools to fit your needs.
    ```sh
    kubectl debug node/<NODE_NAME> --image=docker.io/library/alpine:latest -it
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Run debug commands to help you gather information and troubleshoot issues. Commands that you might use to debug, such as `ip`, `ifconfig`, `nc`, `ping`, and `ps`, are already available in the shell. You can also install other tools, such as `mtr`, `tcpdump`, and `curl`, by running `apk add <tool>`.



## Debugging by using `kubectl exec`
{: #kubectl-exec}

If you are unable to use the `kubectl debug node` command, you can create an Alpine pod with a privileged `securityContext` and use the `kubectl exec` command to run debug commands from the pod's interactive shell.
{: shortdesc}

1. Get the name of the worker node that you want to access. The worker node name is its private IP address.

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Export the name in an environment variable.

    ```sh
    export NODE=<NODE_NAME>
    ```
    {: pre}


3. Create a debug pod on the worker node. The Docker alpine image here is used as an example. If the worker node doesn't have public network access, you can maintain a copy of the image for debugging in your own ICR repository or build a customized image with other tools to fit your needs.

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f - << EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: debug-${NODE}
      namespace: default
    spec:
      containers:
      - args: ["-c", "apk add tcpdump mtr curl; sleep 1d"]
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        image: icr.io/armada-master/alpine:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: debug
        resources: {}
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
          runAsUser: 0
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /host
          name: host-volume
      volumes:
      - name: host-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: ${NODE}
      restartPolicy: Never
      securityContext: {}
    EOF
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Log in to the debug pod. The pod's interactive shell is automatically opened. If the `kubectl exec` command fails, continue to option 3.

    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it debug-${NODE} -- sh
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    
    
    You can use the `**kubectl cp**` command to get logs or other files from a worker node. The following example gets the `/var/log/syslog` file.
    ```sh
    kubectl cp default/debug-${NODE}:/host/var/log/syslog ./syslog
    ```
    {: pre}

    Get the following logs to look for issues on the worker node.
    ```sh
    /var/log/syslog
    /var/log/containerd.log
    /var/log/kubelet.log
    /var/log/kern.log
    ```
    {: screen}

    
    
    

5. Run debug commands to help you gather information and troubleshoot issues. Commands that you might use to debug, such as `ip`, `ifconfig`, `nc`, `ping`, and `ps`, are already available in the shell. You can also install other tools, such as `dig`, `tcpdump`, `mtr`, and `curl`, by running `apk add <tool>`. For example, to add `dig`, run `apk add bind-tools`.

    Before you can use the `tcpdump` command, you must first move the binary to a new location that does not conflict with the install path for the binary on the host. You can use the following command to relocate the binary: `mv /usr/sbin/tcpdump /usr/local/bin/`.
    {: note}

6. Delete the host access pod that you created for debugging.

    ```sh
    kubectl delete pod debug-${NODE}
    ```
    {: pre}



## Debugging by creating a pod with root SSH access
{: #pod-ssh}

If you are unable to use the `kubectl debug node` or `kubectl exec` commands, such as if the VPN connection between the cluster master and worker nodes is down, you can create a pod that enables root SSH access and copies a public SSH key to the worker node for SSH access.
{: shortdesc}

Allowing root SSH access is a security risk. Only allow SSH access when it is required and no other option is available to troubleshoot worker node issues. When you finish troubleshooting, be sure to follow the steps in the [Cleaning up after debugging](#ssh-debug-cleanup) section to disable SSH access.
{: important}

1. Choose an existing or create a new public SSH key.
    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ls ~/.ssh
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    ```sh
    id_rsa id_rsa.pub
    ```
    {: screen}
    
    ```sh
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
    {: pre}
    
2. Get the name of the worker node that you want to access. The worker node name is its private IP address.

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Create the following YAML file for a debug pod, and save the file as `enable-ssh.yaml`. Replace `<NODE_NAME>` with the worker node name and replace the example `value` for `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` with your public SSH key. The Docker alpine image here is used as an example. If the worker node doesn't have public network access, you can maintain a copy of the image for debugging in your own ICR repository or build a customized image with other tools to fit your needs.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: enable-ssh-<NODE_NAME>
      namespace: default
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - operator: "Exists"
      hostNetwork: true
      hostPID: true
      hostIPC: true
      containers:
      - image: docker.io/library/alpine:latest
        env:
        - name: SSH_PUBLIC_KEY
          value: "<ssh-rsa AAA...ZZZ user@ibm.com>"
        args: ["-c", "echo $(SSH_PUBLIC_KEY) | tee -a /root/.ssh/authorized_keys && sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/g' /host/etc/ssh/sshd_config && killall -1 sshd && while true; do sleep 86400; done"]
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        name: enable-ssh
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /host
          name: host-volume
        - mountPath: /root/.ssh
          name: ssh-volume
      volumes:
      - name: host-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /
      - name: ssh-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /root/.ssh
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: <NODE_NAME>
      restartPolicy: Never
    ```
    {: codeblock}

4. Create the pod in your cluster. When this pod is created, your public key is added to the worker node and SSH is configured to allow root SSH login.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f enable-ssh.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Use the private or public network to access the worker node by using your SSH key.

### Private network
{: #ssh-private-network}

Create a new or choose an existing server instance that has access to the same private network as the worker node. For VPC clusters, the [virtual server instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute/vs){: external} must exist in the same VPC as the worker node.
{: shortdesc}

For classic clusters, the [device](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/devices){: external} can access the worker node from any private VLAN if a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint&interface=ui) or [VLAN spanning](/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning) is enabled. Otherwise, the device must exist on the same private VLAN as the worker node.

1. Copy your SSH private key from step 1 from your local machine to this server instance.

    ```sh
    scp <SSH_private_key_location> <user@host>:/.ssh/id_rsa_worker_private
    ```
    {: pre}

2. SSH into the server instance.
    
3. Set the correct permissions for using the SSH private key that you copied.
    
    ```sh
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_worker_private
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Use the private key to SSH into the worker node that you found in step 2.

    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_worker_private root@<WORKER_PRIVATE_IP>
    ```
    {: pre}

### Public network classic clusters that are connected to a public VLAN only
{: #public-network-only-classic-debug}

Debug classic clusters that are connected to a public VLAN by logging in to your worker nodes.
{: shortdesc}
        
1. [Install and configure the Calico CLI, and set the context for your cluster to run Calico commands](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies#cli_install).

2. Create a Calico global network policy that is named `ssh-open` to allow inbound SSH traffic on port 22.

    ```sh
    calicoctl apply [-c <path_to_calicoctl_cfg>/calicoctl.cfg] -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: ssh-open
    spec:
      selector: ibm.role == 'worker_public'
      ingress:
      - action: Allow
        protocol: TCP
        destination:
          ports:
          - 22
      - action: Allow
        protocol: UDP
        destination:
          ports:
          - 22
      order: 1500
    EOF
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Get the public IP address of your worker node.

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

4. SSH into the worker node via its public IP address.
    ```sh
    ssh root@<WORKER_PUBLIC_IP>
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Run debug commands to help you gather information and troubleshoot issues, such as `ip`, `ifconfig`, `nc`, `tcpdump`, `ping`, `ps`, and `curl`. You can also install other tools, such as `mtr`, by running `yum install <tool>`.

### Cleaning up after debugging
{: #ssh-debug-cleanup}

After you finish debugging, clean up resources to disable SSH access.
{: shortdesc}

1. Delete the SSH enablement pod.

    ```sh
    kubectl delete pod enable-ssh-<NODE_NAME>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. If you accessed the worker node via the public network, delete the Calico policy so that port 22 is blocked again.
    ```sh
    calicoctl delete gnp ssh-open [-c <path_to_calicoctl_cfg>/calicoctl.cfg]
    ```
    {: pre}

3. [Reload your classic worker node](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) or [replace your VPC worker node](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli#cli_worker_replace) so that the original SSH configuration is used and the SSH key that you added is removed.
