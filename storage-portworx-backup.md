# Backing up and restoring apps and data with Portworx Backup
{: #storage_portworx_backup}

Portworx Backup is a Portworx proprietary backup solution that is compatible with any {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster. You can use Portworx Backup to back up and restore {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} resources, apps and data across multiple clusters. For more information on Portworx Backup, see [Understanding Portworx Backup](https://backup.docs.portworx.com/understand/){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

To back up the data in your persistent volumes, you must have a storage class that supports snapshots in your cluster. Clusters with Portworx Enterprise have storage classes available that support snapshots by default. However, for clusters that don't have Portworx Enterprise, you must have a storage classes with snapshot support to back up your persistent volume data. The {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} driver, and the {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} driver don't have storage classes that support snapshots. If you have workloads that use these drivers, you can use Portworx Backup to back up your apps, but not the data in the persistent volumes. For more information see [Backing up and restoring cluster data with Portworx Backup](#px-backup-and-restore).
{: important}

## Installing Portworx Backup on an {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster
{: #px-backup-install}

Install Portworx Backup on an {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. After you install Portworx Backup on one cluster in your account, you can use it to back up or restore data and apps for any cluster in that same account.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- Make sure that your cluster meets the [minimum Portworx requirements](https://docs.portworx.com/start-here-installation/){: external}. 
- [Install or update the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in in your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#install_block).
- Provision and attach 320Gi of block storage to your cluster. See [Setting {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage) or [Setting up Block Storage for VPC](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-block).




1. Open the Portworx Backup service from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/px-backup-for-kubernetes){: external}.
2. Select the same location where the  cluster you want to install Portworx Backup on is located. You can find the location of your cluster from the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} dashboard.
3. Enter the name for your Portworx Backup service in the **Service name** field.
4. Select the resource group where you want to create the Portworx Backup service.
5. In the **Tag** field, enter the name of the cluster where you want to install PX-Backup. After you complete the installation, you can't see the name of the cluster where you installed PX-Backup. To find the cluster more easily later, make sure that you enter the cluster name and any additional information as tags.
6. Enter your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key. After you enter the API key, the **Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster name** field appears. If you don't have an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key, see [Creating an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key) to create one.
7. In the **Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster name** field, select the cluster where you want to install PX-Backup.
8. Enter the name of the Kubernetes namespace where you want to install your Portworx Backup service components. Do not use the `kube-system` or `default` namespace. If the Kubernetes namespace that you enter does not already exist in your cluster, it is automatically created during the installation.
9. Select an existing storage class in your cluster to provision persistent volumes for the Portworx Backup service. The service uses this storage to store service metadata and is not used to back up your apps and data. [Your apps and data are backed up to an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance](#px-backup-storage).
10. Click **Create** to begin the Portworx Backup installation. The installation may take a few minutes to complete.
11. [Verify that your Portworx Backup service is installed correctly](#px-backup-verify).

    ```sh
    kubectl config view --flatten --minify
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Copy the entire `kubeconfig` CLI output and paste it into the **`Kubeconfig`** field in the Portworx Backup console.
6. Select **Others** as your **Kubernetes Service**.
7. If the cluster that you want to add to the Portworx Backup service does not have Portworx installed in it, [you must install Stork onto the cluster](#px-backup-stork). If you installed Portworx Enterprise in your cluster, Stork is installed by default.
8. Click **Submit**. If your cluster is successfully added, you are redirected to the **Backups** page. Make sure that your cluster is listed.
9. [Back up data from your cluster](#px-backup-and-restore).
10. Repeat these steps to add more clusters to your Portworx Backup service.

## Installing Stork on a non-Portworx cluster
{: #px-backup-stork}

If a cluster that you want to back up with Portworx Backup does not have Portworx Enterprise installed on it, you must install Stork on to the cluster before adding it to your Portworx Backup service.
{: shortdesc}

1. From the **Add Cluster** page in the Portworx Backup console, copy the command to install Stork on a **Non-PX** cluster.
2. Open a text editor and paste the command.
3. Copy the URL in the command and enter it in to your web browser to open the YAML file for the Stork installation.
4. Copy and paste the entire YAML file into a new file in your text editor.
5. If the cluster you want to add is a private cluster, find the **image** field and replace `openstorage/stork:<version_number>` with `icr.io/ext/portworx/stork:<version_numer>`. To find the latest available version of Stork, see the [Stork releases](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork/releases){: external}.
    ```sh
    - --health-monitor-interval=120
    - --webhook-controller=false
    image: openstore/stork:2.6.2
    imagePullPolicy:Always
    resources:
      requests:
         cpu: '0.1'
      name: stork
   serviceAccountName: stork-account  
    ```
    {: screen}

6. Save the file and run the command to apply the file to your cluster and install Stork.
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f <file_name>.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

## Backing up and restoring cluster data with PX-Backup
{: #px-backup-and-restore}


To back up data from your cluster or to restore data to your cluster, refer to the [Portworx Backup documentation](https://backup.docs.portworx.com/use-px-backup/backup-restore/){: external}.
{: shortdesc}

**Back up apps and data from your cluster to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}**: 
You can back up an entire cluster namespace, single apps, and the data that is stored in your persistent volumes to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance that you set up as your backup location. Note that to back up data in persistent volumes, you must have a CSI snapshot storage class in your cluster. Portworx Backup uses this storage class to first take a snapshot of your data and then sends this data to your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} backup location. For more information, see the [Portworx Backup documentation](https://backup.docs.portworx.com/use-px-backup/backup-restore/create-backup/perform-backup/){: external}.

**Restore any backup that you created to another cluster**: 
You can restore an entire namespace, your apps, or your data to any cluster that you added to the Portworx Backup service. Use this Portworx Backup capability if you want to migrate apps and data from one cluster to another. For more information, see the [Portworx Backup documentation](https://backup.docs.portworx.com/use-px-backup/backup-restore/restore-backup/){: external}.
