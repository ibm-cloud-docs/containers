Choice of container platform provider
:   Deploy clusters with **{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}}** or community **Kubernetes** installed as the container platform orchestrator.
:   Choose the developer experience that fits your company, or run workloads across both {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} or community Kubernetes clusters.
:   Built-in integrations from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to the Kubernetes dashboard or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} web console.
:   Single view and management experience of all your {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} or community Kubernetes clusters from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 


Single-tenant Kubernetes clusters with compute, network, and storage infrastructure isolation
:  Create your own customized infrastructure that meets the requirements of your organization.
:  Choose between infrastructure providers.
:   Provision a dedicated and secured Kubernetes master, worker nodes, virtual networks, and storage by using the resources provided by IBM Cloud infrastructure.
:   Fully managed Kubernetes master that is continuously monitored and updated by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to keep your cluster available.
:   Option to provision worker nodes as bare metal servers for compute-intensive workloads such as data, GPU, and AI.
:   Store persistent data, share data between Kubernetes pods, and restore data when needed with the integrated and secure volume service.
:   Benefit from full support for all native Kubernetes APIs.

Multizone clusters to increase high availability
:   Easily manage worker nodes of the same flavor (CPU, memory, virtual or physical) with worker pools.
:   Guard against zone failure by spreading nodes evenly across select multizones and by using anti-affinity pod deployments for your apps.
:   Decrease your costs by using multizone clusters instead of duplicating the resources in a separate cluster.
:   Benefit from automatic load balancing across apps with the multizone load balancer (MZLB) that is set up automatically for you in each zone of the cluster.


Highly available masters
:   Reduce cluster downtime such as during master updates with highly available masters that are provisioned automatically when you create a cluster.
:   Spread your masters across zones in a multizone cluster to protect your cluster from zonal failures.

Image security compliance with Vulnerability Advisor
:   Set up your own repo in a secured Docker private image registry where images are stored and shared by all users in the organization.
:   Benefit from automatic scanning of images in your private {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} registry.
:   Review recommendations specific to the operating system used in the image to fix potential vulnerabilities.

Continuous monitoring of the cluster health
:   Use the cluster dashboard to quickly see and manage the health of your cluster, worker nodes, and container deployments.
:   Find detailed consumption metrics by using {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} and quickly expand your cluster to meet work loads.
:   Review logging information by using {{site.data.keyword.la_full}} to see detailed cluster activities.

Secure exposure of apps to the public
:   Choose between a public IP address, an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provided route, or your own custom domain to access services in your cluster from the internet.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service integration
:   Add extra capabilities to your app through the integration of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.watson}} APIs, Blockchain, data services, or Internet of Things.
