# Logging and monitoring
{: #health}

Set up logging and monitoring in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to help you troubleshoot issues and improve the health and performance of your Kubernetes clusters and apps.
{: shortdesc}

## Understanding cluster and app log forwarding
{: #logging}

Continuous monitoring and logging is the key to detecting attacks on your cluster and troubleshooting issues as they arise. By continuously monitoring your cluster, you're able to better understand your cluster capacity and the availability of resources that are available to your app. This allows you to prepare accordingly to protect your apps against downtime. To configure logging, you must be working with a standard Kubernetes cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}


**Does IBM monitor my cluster?**
Every Kubernetes master is continuously monitored by IBM. {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} automatically scans every node where the Kubernetes master is deployed for vulnerabilities that are found in Kubernetes and OS-specific security fixes. If vulnerabilities are found, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} automatically applies fixes and resolves vulnerabilities on behalf of the user to ensure master node protection. You are responsible for monitoring and analyzing the logs for the rest of your cluster.

**What are the sources that I can configure logging for?**

In the following image you can see the location of the sources that you can configure logging for.

![Log sources](images/log_sources.png)

<ol>
<li><p><code>application</code>: Information about events that occur at the application level. This could be a notification that an event has taken place such as a successful login, a warning about storage, or other operations that can be performed at the app level.</p> <p>Paths: You can set the paths that your logs are forwarded to. However, in order for logs to be sent, you must use an absolute path in your logging configuration or the logs cannot be read. If your path is mounted to your worker node, it might have created a symlink. Example: If the specified path is <code>/usr/local/<b>spark</b>/work/app-0546/0/stderr</code> but the logs actually go to <code>/usr/local/<b>spark-1.0-hadoop-1.2</b>/work/app-0546/0/stderr</code>, then the logs cannot be read.</p></li>

<li><p><code>container</code>: Information that is logged by a running container.</p> <p>Paths: Anything written to <code>STDOUT</code> or <code>STDERR</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>ingress</code>: Information about the network traffic that comes into a cluster through the Ingress Application Load Balancer. For specific configuration information, check out the [Ingress documentation](cs_ingress.html#ingress_log_format).</p> <p>Paths: <code>/var/log/alb/ids/&ast;.log</code> <code>/var/log/alb/ids/&ast;.err</code>, <code>/var/log/alb/customerlogs/&ast;.log</code>, <code>/var/log/alb/customerlogs/&ast;.err</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>kube-audit</code>: Information about cluster-related actions that is sent to the Kubernetes API server; including the time, the user, and the affected resource.</p></li>

<li><p><code>kubernetes</code>: Information from the kubelet, the kube-proxy, and other Kubernetes events that happen in the worker node. that run in the kube-system namespace.</p><p>Paths: <code>/var/log/kubelet.log</code>, <code>/var/log/kube-proxy.log</code>, <code>/var/log/event-exporter/*.log</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>worker</code>: Information that is specific to the infrastructure configuration that you have for your worker node. Worker logs are captured in syslog and contain operating system events. In auth.log you can find information on the authentication requests that are made to the OS. </p><p>Paths: <code>/var/log/syslog</code> and <code>/var/log/auth.log</code></p></li>
</ol>

</br>

**What are the configuration options that I have?**

**Am I responsible for keeping Fluentd for logging updated?**

In order to make changes to your logging or filter configurations, the Fluentd logging add-on must be at the latest version. By default, automatic updates to the add-on are enabled. To disable automatic updates, see [Updating cluster add-ons: Fluentd for logging](cs_cluster_update.html#logging).

## Configuring log forwarding
{: #configuring}

You can configure logging for {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} through the GUI or through the CLI.
{: shortdesc}

### Enabling log forwarding with the GUI
{: #enable-forwarding-ui}

You can configure log forwarding in the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} dashboard. It can take a few minutes for the process to complete, so if you don't see logs immediately, try waiting a few minutes and then check back.

To create a configuration at the account level, for a specific container namespace, or for app logging use the CLI.
{: tip}

1. Navigate to the **Overview** tab of the dashboard.
2. Select the Cloud Foundry org and space from which you want to forward logs. When you configure log forwarding in the dashboard, logs are sent to the default {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}} endpoint for your cluster. To forward logs to an external server, or to another {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}} endpoint, you can use the CLI to configure logging.
3. Select the log sources from which you want to forward logs.
4. Click **Create**.

</br>
</br>

### Enabling log forwarding with the CLI
{: #enable-forwarding}

You can create a configuration for cluster logging. You can differentiate between the different logging options by using flags.

**Forwarding logs to IBM**

1. Verify permissions. If you specified a space when you created the cluster or the logging configuration, then both the account owner and {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} API key owner need Manager, Developer, or Auditor [permissions](cs_users.html#access_policies) in that space.
  * If you don't know who the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} API key owner is, run the following command.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks api-key-info <cluster_name>
      ```
      {: pre}
  * To immediately apply any changes that you made, run the following command.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks logging-config-refresh <cluster_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

2. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where the log source is located.

  If you are using a Dedicated account, you must log in to the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint and target your public org and space in order to enable log forwarding.
  {: tip}

3. Create a log forwarding configuration.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-create <cluster_name_or_ID> --logsource <log_source> --type ibm --namespace <kubernetes_namespace> --hostname <log_server_hostname_or_IP> --port <log_server_port> --space <cluster_space> --org <cluster_org> --app-containers <containers> --app-paths <paths_to_logs> --skip-validation
    ```
    {: pre}

  * Example container logging configuration for the default namespace and output:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-create mycluster
    Creating cluster mycluster logging configurations...
    OK
    ID                                      Source      Namespace    Host                                 Port    Org  Space   Server Type   Protocol   Application Containers   Paths

    aa2b415e-3158-48c9-94cf-f8b298a5ae39   application    -          ingest.logging.stage1.ng.bluemix.net✣  9091✣    -      -          ibm         -        container1,container2,container3      /var/log/apps.log
    ✣ Indicates the default endpoint for the {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}} service.
    ```
    {: screen}

If you have apps that run in your containers that can't be configured to write logs to STDOUT or STDERR, you can create a logging configuration to forward logs from app log files.
{: tip}

</br>
</br>


**Forwarding logs to your own server over the `udp` or `tcp` protocols**

1. To forward logs to syslog, set up a server that accepts a syslog protocol in one of two ways:
  * Set up and manage your own server or have a provider manage it for you. If a provider manages the server for you, get the logging endpoint from the logging provider.

  * Run syslog from a container. For example, you can use this [deployment .yaml file ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/deploy-apps-clusters/deploy-syslog-from-kube.yaml) to fetch a Docker public image that runs a container in a Kubernetes cluster. The image publishes the port `514` on the public cluster IP address, and uses this public cluster IP address to configure the syslog host.

  You can see your logs as valid JSON by removing syslog prefixes. To do so, add the following code to the top of your <code>etc/rsyslog.conf</code> file where your rsyslog server is running: <code>$template customFormat,"%msg%\n"</br>$ActionFileDefaultTemplate customFormat</code>
  {: tip}

2. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where the log source is located. If you are using a Dedicated account, you must log in to the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint and target your public org and space in order to enable log forwarding.

3. Create a log forwarding configuration.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-create <cluster_name_or_ID> --logsource <log_source> --namespace <kubernetes_namespace> --hostname <log_server_hostname_or_IP> --port <log_server_port> --type syslog --app-containers <containers> --app-paths <paths_to_logs> --syslog-protocol <protocol> --skip-validation
    ```
    {: pre}

</br>
</br>


**Forwarding logs to your own server over the `tls` protocol**

The following steps are general instructions. Prior to using the container in a production environment, be sure that any security requirements that you need, are met.
{: tip}

1. Set up a server that accepts a syslog protocol in one of two ways:
  * Set up and manage your own server or have a provider manage it for you. If a provider manages the server for you, get the logging endpoint from the logging provider.

  * Run syslog from a container. For example, you can use this [deployment .yaml file ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/deploy-apps-clusters/deploy-syslog-from-kube.yaml) to fetch a Docker public image that runs a container in a Kubernetes cluster. The image publishes the port `514` on the public cluster IP address, and uses this public cluster IP address to configure the syslog host. You will need to inject the relevant Certificate Authority and server-side certificates and update the `syslog.conf` to enable `tls` on your server.

2. Save your Certificate Authority certificate to a file named `ca-cert`. It must be that exact name.

3. Create a secret in the `kube-system` namespace for the `ca-cert` file. When you create your logging configuration, you will use the secret name for the `--ca-cert` flag.
    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system create secret generic --from-file=ca-cert
    ```
    {: pre}

4. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where the log source is located. If you are using a Dedicated account, you must log in to the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint and target your public org and space in order to enable log forwarding.

3. Create a log forwarding configuration.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-create <cluster name or id> --logsource <log source> --type syslog --syslog-protocol tls --hostname <ip address of syslog server> --port <port for syslog server, 514 is default> --ca-cert <secret name> --verify-mode <defaults to verify-none>
    ```
    {: pre}

</br>
</br>


### Verifying log forwarding
{: verify-logging}

You can verify that your configuration is set up correctly in one of two ways:

* To list all of the logging configurations in a cluster:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-get <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

* To list the logging configurations for one type of log source:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-get <cluster_name_or_ID> --logsource <source>
    ```
    {: pre}

</br>
</br>

### Updating log forwarding
{: #updating-forwarding}

You can update a logging configuration that you already created.

1. Update a log forwarding configuration.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-update <cluster_name_or_ID> <log_config_id> --namespace <namespace> --type <server_type> --syslog-protocol <protocol> --logsource <source> --hostname <hostname_or_ingestion_URL> --port <port> --space <cluster_space> --org <cluster_org> --app-containers <containers> --app-paths <paths_to_logs>
    ```
    {: pre}

</br>
</br>

### Stopping log forwarding
{: #log_sources_delete}

You can stop forwarding logs one or all of the logging configurations for a cluster.
{: shortdesc}

1. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where the log source is located.

2. Delete the logging configuration.
  <ul>
  <li>To delete one logging configuration:</br>
    <pre><code>ibmcloud ks logging-config-rm &lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt; --id &lt;log_config_ID&gt;</pre></code></li>
  <li>To delete all of the logging configurations:</br>
    <pre><code>ibmcloud ks logging-config-rm <my_cluster> --all</pre></code></li>
  </ul>

</br>
</br>

### Viewing logs
{: #view_logs}

To view logs for clusters and containers, you can use the standard Kubernetes and container runtime logging features.
{:shortdesc}

**{{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}}**
{: #view_logs_k8s}

You can view the logs that you forwarded to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysislong_notm}} through the Kibana dashboard.
{: shortdesc}

If you used the default values to create your configuration file, then your logs can be found in the account, or org and space, in which the cluster was created. If you specified an org and space in your configuration file, then you can find your logs in that space. For more information about logging, see [Logging for {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/containers/containers_kubernetes.html#containers_kubernetes).

To access the Kibana dashboard, go to one of the following URLs and select the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account or space where you configured log forwarding for the cluster.
- US-South and US-East: https://logging.ng.bluemix.net
- UK-South: https://logging.eu-gb.bluemix.net
- EU-Central: https://logging.eu-fra.bluemix.net
- AP-South: https://logging.au-syd.bluemix.net

For more information about viewing logs, see [Navigating to Kibana from a web browser](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/kibana/launch.html#launch_Kibana_from_browser).

</br>

**Container logs**

You can leverage the built-in container runtime logging capabilities to review activities on the standard STDOUT and STDERR output streams. For more information, see [Viewing container logs for a container that runs in a Kubernetes cluster](/docs/services/CloudLogAnalysis/containers/containers_kubernetes.html#containers_kubernetes).

<br />


## Filtering logs
{: #filter-logs}

You can choose which logs that you forward by filtering out specific logs for a period of time. You can differentiate between the different filtering options by using flags.

## Configuring log forwarding for Kubernetes API audit logs
{: #api_forward}

Kubernetes automatically audits any events that are passed through your apiserver. You can forward the events to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}} or to an external server.
{: shortdesc}


For more information about Kubernetes audit logs, see the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/" target="blank">auditing topic <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> in the Kubernetes documentation.

* Forwarding for Kubernetes API audit logs is only supported for Kubernetes version 1.7 and later.
* Currently, a default audit policy is used for all clusters with this logging configuration.
* Currently, filters are not supported.
* There can be only one `kube-audit` configuration per cluster, but you can forward logs to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}} and an external server by creating a logging configuration and a webhook.
{: tip}


### Sending audit logs to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}}
{: #audit_enable_loganalysis}

You can forward your Kubernetes API server audit logs to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisshort_notm}}

**Before you begin**

1. Verify permissions. If you specified a space when you created the cluster or the logging configuration, then both the account owner and {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} key owner need Manager, Developer, or Auditor permissions in that space.

2. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster that you want to collect API server audit logs from. **Note**: If you are using a Dedicated account, you must log in to the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint and target your public org and space in order to enable log forwarding.

**Forwarding logs**

1. Create a logging configuration.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-create <cluster_name_or_ID> --logsource kube-audit --space <cluster_space> --org <cluster_org> --hostname <ingestion_URL> --type ibm
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example command and output:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks logging-config-create myCluster --logsource kube-audit

3. Optional: If you want to stop forwarding audit logs, you can [delete your configuration](#log_sources_delete).

<br />



### Sending audit logs to an external server
{: #audit_enable}

**Before you begin**

1. Set up a remote logging server where you can forward the logs. For example, you can [use Logstash with Kubernetes ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#use-logstash-to-collect-and-distribute-audit-events-from-webhook-backend) to collect audit events.

2. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster that you want to collect API server audit logs from. **Note**: If you are using a Dedicated account, you must log in to the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint and target your public org and space in order to enable log forwarding.

To forward Kubernetes API audit logs:

1. Set up the webhook. If you do not provide any information in the flags, a default configuration is used.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks apiserver-config-set audit-webhook <cluster_name_or_ID> --remoteServer <server_URL_or_IP> --caCert <CA_cert_path> --clientCert <client_cert_path> --clientKey <client_key_path>
    ```
    {: pre}

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code><em>&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;</em></code></td>
        <td>The name or ID of the cluster.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code><em>&lt;server_URL&gt;</em></code></td>
        <td>The URL or IP address for the remote logging service that you want to send logs to. Certificates are ignored if you provide an unsecure server URL.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code><em>&lt;CA_cert_path&gt;</em></code></td>
        <td>The file path for the CA certificate that is used to verify the remote logging service.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code><em>&lt;client_cert_path&gt;</em></code></td>
        <td>The file path for the client certificate that is used to authenticate against the remote logging service.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code><em>&lt;client_key_path&gt;</em></code></td>
        <td>The file path for the corresponding client key that is used to connect to the remote logging service.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

2. Verify that log forwarding was enabled by viewing the URL for the remote logging service.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks apiserver-config-get audit-webhook <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    OK
    Server:			https://8.8.8.8
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Apply the configuration update by restarting the Kubernetes master.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks apiserver-refresh <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Optional: If you want to stop forwarding audit logs, you can disable your configuration.
    1. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster that you want to stop collecting API server audit logs from.
    2. Disable the webhook back-end configuration for the cluster's API server.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks apiserver-config-unset audit-webhook <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

    3. Apply the configuration update by restarting the Kubernetes master.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks apiserver-refresh <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

## Viewing metrics
{: #view_metrics}

Metrics help you monitor the health and performance of your clusters. You can use the standard Kubernetes and container runtime features to monitor the health of your clusters and apps. **Note**: Monitoring is supported only for standard clusters.

<dl>
  <dt>Cluster details page in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}</dt>
    <dd>{{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} provides information about the health and capacity of your cluster and the usage of your cluster resources. You can use this GUI to scale out your cluster, work with your persistent storage, and add more capabilities to your cluster through {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service binding. To view the cluster details page, go to your **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard** and select a cluster.</dd>
  <dt>Kubernetes dashboard</dt>
    <dd>The Kubernetes dashboard is an administrative web interface where you can review the health of your worker nodes, find Kubernetes resources, deploy containerized apps, and troubleshoot apps with logging and monitoring information.

## Configuring health monitoring for worker nodes with Autorecovery
{: #autorecovery}

The {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} Autorecovery system can be deployed into existing clusters of Kubernetes version 1.7 or later.
{: shortdesc}

The Autorecovery system uses various checks to query worker node health status. If Autorecovery detects an unhealthy worker node based on the configured checks, Autorecovery triggers a corrective action like an OS reload on the worker node. Only one worker node undergoes a corrective action at a time. The worker node must successfully complete the corrective action before any other worker node undergoes a corrective action. For more information, see this [Autorecovery blog post ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/12/autorecovery-utilizes-consistent-hashing-high-availability/).</br> </br>
**Note**: Autorecovery requires at least one healthy node to function properly. Configure Autorecovery with active checks only in clusters with two or more worker nodes.

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where you want to check worker node statuses.

1. [Install Helm for your cluster and add the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} repository to your Helm instance](cs_integrations.html#helm).

2. Create a configuration map file that defines your checks in JSON format. For example, the following YAML file defines three checks: an HTTP check and two Kubernetes API server checks. Refer to the tables following the example YAML file for information about the three kinds of checks and information about the individual components of the checks.
</br>
   **Tip:** Define each check as a unique key in the `data` section of the configuration map.

   ```

To use this check you must deploy an HTTP server on every worker node in your cluster by using a [DaemonSet ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). You must implement a health check that is available at the <code>/myhealth</code> path and that can verify if your HTTP server is healthy. You can define other paths by changing the <strong>Route</strong> parameter. If the HTTP server is healthy, you must return the HTTP response code that is defined in <strong>ExpectedStatus</strong>. The HTTP server must be configured to listen on the private IP address of the worker node. You can find the private IP address by running <code>kubectl get nodes</code>.<br></br>
   For example, consider two nodes in a cluster that have the private IP addresses 10.10.10.1 and 10.10.10.2. In this example, two routes are checked for a 200 HTTP response: <code>http://10.10.10.1:80/myhealth</code> and <code>http://10.10.10.2:80/myhealth</code>.
   The check in the example YAML runs every 3 minutes. If it fails three consecutive times, the worker node is rebooted. This action is equivalent to running <code>ibmcloud ks worker-reboot</code>.<br></br>The HTTP check is disabled until you set the <b>Enabled</b> field to <code>true</code>.</td>

3. Create the configuration map in your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f ibm-worker-recovery-checks.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that you created the configuration map with the name `ibm-worker-recovery-checks` in the `kube-system` namespace with the proper checks.

    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system get cm ibm-worker-recovery-checks -o yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Deploy Autorecovery into your cluster by installing the `ibm-worker-recovery` Helm chart.

    ```
    helm install --name ibm-worker-recovery ibm/ibm-worker-recovery  --namespace kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

5. After a few minutes, you can check the `Events` section in the output of the following command to see activity on the Autorecovery deployment.

    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system describe deployment ibm-worker-recovery
    ```
    {: pre}

6. If you are not seeing activity on the Autorecovery deployment, you can check the Helm deployment by running the tests that are included in the Autorecovery chart definition.

    ```
    helm test ibm-worker-recovery
    ```
    {: pre}
