{: note}

## Overview of VPC networking in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
{: #vpc_basics}

Understand the basic concepts of VPC networking in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters.
{: shortdesc}

### Subnets
{: #vpc_basics_subnets}

Before you create a VPC cluster for the first time, you must [create a VPC subnet](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc/provision/network){: external} in each zone where you want to deploy worker nodes. A VPC subnet is a specified private IP address range (CIDR block) and configures a group of worker nodes and pods as if they are attached to the same physical wire.
{: shortdesc}

When you create a cluster, you can specify only one existing VPC subnet for each zone. Each worker node that you add in a cluster is deployed with a private IP address from the VPC subnet in that zone. After the worker node is provisioned, the worker node IP address persists after a `reboot` operation, but the worker node IP address changes after `replace` and `update` operations.

Do not delete the subnets that you attach to your cluster during cluster creation or when you add worker nodes in a zone. If you delete a VPC subnet that your cluster used, any load balancers that use IP addresses from the subnet might experience issues, and you might be unable to create new load balancers.
{: important}

**How many IP addresses do I need for my VPC subnet?**<br>
When you [create your VPC subnet](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc/provision/network){: external}, make sure to create a subnet with enough IP addresses for your cluster, such as 256. You cannot change the number of IP addresses that a VPC subnet has later.

Keep in mind the following IP address reservations.
* 5 IP addresses are [reserved by VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-networking-for-vpc#reserved-ip-addresses) from each subnet by default.
* 1 IP address is required per worker node in your cluster.
* 1 IP address is required each time that you update or replace a worker node. These IP addresses are eventually reclaimed and available for reuse.
* 2 IP addresses are used each time that you create a public or private load balancer. If you have a multizone cluster, these 2 IP addresses are spread across zones, so the subnet might not have an IP address reserved.
* Other networking resources that you set up for the cluster, such as a VPNaaS or LBaaS autoscaling, might require additional IP addresses or have other [service limitations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-limitations). For example, LBaaS autoscaling might scale up to 16 IP addresses per load balancer.

**What IP ranges can I use for my VPC subnets?**<br>
{: #vpc-ip-range}
The default IP address range for VPC subnets is 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255. Your worker nodes are assigned an IP address from this range. For a list of IP address ranges per VPC zone, see [VPC default address prefixes](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network-working-with-ip-address-ranges-address-prefixes-regions-and-subnets#default-vpc-address-prefixes).

If you need to create your cluster by using custom-range subnets, see the guidance for [custom address prefixes](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network-working-with-ip-address-ranges-address-prefixes-regions-and-subnets#address-prefixes-and-the-ibm-cloud-console-ui). However, if you use custom-range subnets for your worker nodes, you must ensure that the IP range for the worker node subnets do not overlap with your cluster's pod subnet. The pod subnet varies depending on your subnet choices during cluster creation:
* If you specified your own pod subnet in the `--pod-subnet` flag during cluster creation, your pods are assigned IP addresses from this range.
* If you did not specify a custom pod subnet during cluster creation, your cluster uses the default pod subnet, `172.30.0.0/16`.

### Public gateways
{: #vpc_basics_pgw}

If your worker nodes must access a public endpoint outside of the cluster, you can enable a public gateway on the VPC subnet that the worker nodes are deployed to. A public gateway enables a subnet and all worker nodes that are attached to the subnet to establish outbound connections to the internet.
{: shortdesc}

For example, if an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service does not support private service endpoints, your worker nodes must be connected to a subnet that has a public gateway attached to it. The pods on those worker nodes can securely communicate with the services over the public network through the subnet's public gateway. Note that a public gateway is not required on your subnets to allow inbound network traffic from the internet to `LoadBalancer` services or ALBs.

A public gateway can be attached to or detached from a subnet at any time, and you can enable a public gateway only for one subnet per zone. For more information about public gateways, see the [Networking for Virtual Private Cloud (Gen 1 compute) documentation](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network-about-networking-for-vpc#use-a-public-gateway).

### Network segmentation
{: #vpc_basics_segmentation}

Network segmentation describes the approach to divide a network into multiple sub-networks. Apps that run in one sub-network cannot see or access apps in another sub-network. For more information about network segmentation options for VPC subnets, see [this cluster security topic](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#network_segmentation_vpc).
{: shortdesc}

Subnets provide a channel for connectivity among the worker nodes within the cluster. Additionally, any system that is connected to any of the private subnets in the same VPC can communicate with workers. For example, all subnets in one VPC can communicate through private layer 3 routing with a built-in VPC router.

If you have multiple clusters that must communicate with each other, you can create the clusters in the same VPC. However, if your clusters do not need to communicate, you can achieve better network segmentation by creating the clusters in separate VPCs. You can also create [access control lists (ACLs)](/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network-setting-up-network-acls) for your VPC subnets to mediate traffic on the private network. ACLs consist of inbound and outbound rules that define which ingress and egress is permitted for each VPC subnet.

### VPC networking limitations
{: #vpc_basics_limitations}

When you create VPC subnets for your clusters, keep in mind the following features and limitations.
{: shortdesc}

* The default CIDR size of each VPC subnet is `/24`, which can support up to 253 worker nodes. If you plan to deploy more than 250 worker nodes per zone in one cluster, consider creating a subnet of a larger size.
* After you create a VPC subnet, you cannot resize it or change its IP range.
* Multiple clusters in the same VPC can share subnets.
* VPC subnets are bound to a single zone and cannot span multiple zones or regions.
* After you create a subnet, you cannot move it to a different zone, region, or VPC.
* If you have worker nodes that are attached to an existing subnet in a zone, you cannot change the subnet for that zone in the cluster.
* The `172.16.0.0/16`, `172.18.0.0/16`, `172.19.0.0/16`, and `172.20.0.0/16` ranges are prohibited.
* You can enable a public gateway only one subnet per zone.

## Creating a VPC subnet and attaching a public gateway
{: #create_vpc_subnet}

Create a VPC subnet for your cluster and optionally attach a public gateway to the subnet.
{: shortdesc}

### Creating a VPC subnet in the console
{: #create_vpc_subnet_ui}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to create a VPC subnet for your cluster and optionally attach a public gateway to the subnet.
{: shortdesc}

1. From the [VPC subnet dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc/network/subnets), click **New subnet**.
2. Enter a name for your subnet and select the name of the VPC that you created.
3. Select the location and zone where you want to create the subnet.
4. Specify the number of IP addresses to create.
  * VPC subnets provide IP addresses for your worker nodes and load balancer services in the cluster, so [create a VPC subnet with enough IP addresses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_subnets), such as 256. You cannot change the number of IPs that a VPC subnet has later.
  * If you enter a specific IP range, do not use the following reserved ranges: `172.16.0.0/16`, `172.18.0.0/16`, `172.19.0.0/16`, and `172.20.0.0/16`.
5. Choose if you want to attach a public network gateway to your subnet. A public network gateway is required when you want your cluster to access public endpoints, such as a public URL of another app, or an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service that supports public service endpoints only.
6. Click **Create subnet**.
7. Use the subnet to [create a cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters_vpc_ui), [create a new worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#vpc_add_pool), or [add the subnet to an existing worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#vpc_add_zone).<p class="important">Do not delete the subnets that you attach to your cluster during cluster creation or when you add worker nodes in a zone. If you delete a VPC subnet that your cluster used, any load balancers that use IP addresses from the subnet might experience issues, and you might be unable to create new load balancers.</p>

### Creating a VPC subnet in the CLI
{: #create_vpc_subnet_cli}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI to create a VPC subnet for your cluster and optionally attach a public gateway to the subnet.
{: shortdesc}

**Before you begin:**
1. In your terminal, log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and target the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region and resource group where you want to create your VPC cluster. For supported regions, see [Creating a VPC in a different region](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-in-a-different-region). The cluster's resource group can differ from the VPC resource group. Enter your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials when prompted. If you have a federated ID, use the `--sso` flag to log in.
   ```
   ibmcloud login -r <region> [--sso]
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Target the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure generation **1** for VPC.
   ```
   ibmcloud is target --gen 1
   ```
   {: pre}

3. [Create a VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-cli#create-a-vpc-cli) in the same region where you want to create the cluster.

**To create a VPC subnet:**

1. Get the ID of the VPC where you want to create the subnet.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks vpcs
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Create the subnet. For more information about the options in this command, see the [CLI reference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-cli#create-a-subnet-cli).
  ```
  ibmcloud is subnet-create <subnet_name> <vpc_id> --zone <vpc_zone> --ipv4-address-count <number_of_ip_address>
  ```
  {: pre}
    * VPC subnets provide IP addresses for your worker nodes and load balancer services in the cluster, so [create a VPC subnet with enough IP addresses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_subnets), such as 256. You cannot change the number of IPs that a VPC subnet has later.
    * Do not use the following reserved ranges: `172.16.0.0/16`, `172.18.0.0/16`, `172.19.0.0/16`, and `172.20.0.0/16`.

3. Use the subnet to [create a cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#cluster_vpc_cli), [create a new worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#vpc_add_pool), or [add the subnet to an existing worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#vpc_add_zone).<p class="important">Do not delete the subnets that you attach to your cluster during cluster creation or when you add worker nodes in a zone. If you delete a VPC subnet that your cluster used, any load balancers that use IP addresses from the subnet might experience issues, and you might be unable to create new load balancers.</p>

## Restricting public network traffic to a subnet with a public gateway
{: #vpc-restrict-gateway}

Improve the security of your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} cluster by allowing fewer worker nodes to have external access through a VPC subnet public gateway.
{:shortdesc}

If pods on your worker nodes need to connect to a public external endpoint, you can attach a public gateway to the subnet that those worker nodes are on. For example, your VPC cluster can automatically connect to other [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that support private service endpoints](/docs/resources?topic=resources-private-network-endpoints), such as {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}. However, if you need to access {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that support only public service endpoints, you can attach a public gateway to the subnet so that your pods can send requests over the public network.

You can isolate this network traffic in your cluster by attaching a public gateway to only one subnet in your cluster. Then, you can use app affinity to deploy app pods that require access to external endpoints to only the subnet with an attached public gateway.

In VPC clusters, a subnet is limited to one zone. When you attach a public gateway to only one subnet, and schedule app pods that require public access to only worker nodes on that subnet, these pods are isolated to one zone in your cluster.
{: note}

1. Target the region of the VPC that your cluster is deployed to.
  ```
  ibmcloud target -r <region>
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Check whether you have a public gateway in a zone where you have worker nodes. Within one VPC, you can create only one public gateway per zone.
  ```
  ibmcloud is public-gateways
  ```
  {: pre}

3. List the worker nodes in your cluster. For the zone where you enabled the public gateway, note the **Primary IP** of one worker node.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks worker ls -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:

6. In the deployment file for your app, [add an affinity rule](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/){: external} for the subnet ID label that you found in step 4.

    In the **affinity** section of this example YAML, `ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/subnet-id` is the `key` and `<subnet_ID>` is the `value`.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: with-node-affinity
    spec:
      template:

    ```
    {: codeblock}

7. Apply the updated deployment configuration file.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f with-node-affinity.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

8. Verify that the app pods deployed to the correct worker nodes.

    1. List the pods in your cluster. In the output, identify a pod for your app. Note the **NODE** private IP address of the worker node that the pod is on.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -o wide
        ```
        {: pre}

        In this example output, the app pod `cf-py-d7b7d94db-vp8pq` is on a worker node with the IP address `10.240.01.00`.
        ```
        NAME                   READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE       IP               NODE

        ```
        {: screen}

    2. List the worker nodes in your cluster. In the output, look for the worker nodes in the zone where you attached the public gateway. Verify that the worker node with the private IP address that you identified in the previous step is deployed in this zone.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
