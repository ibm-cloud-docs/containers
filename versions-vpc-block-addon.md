- Resolves the following CVEs: [CVE-2021-3712](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3712) and [CVE-2021-3521](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3521){: external}, [CVE-2022-23772](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23772){: external}, [CVE-2022-23773](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23773){: external}, and [CVE-2022-23806](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23806){: external}.
- Updates Golang to version 1.16.14.

After updating to version 4.2, you must complete the following steps.
{: important}

* [Delete and recreate](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-block#vpc-addon-update) any custom storage classes that are using the `sizeRange` or `iopsRange` parameters.
* If you use a default storage class other than `ibmc-vpc-block-10iops-tier`, you must change the `isStorageClassDefault` setting to `false` in the `addon-vpc-block-csi-driver-configmap` configmap in the `kube-system` namespace. For more information, see [Changing the default storage class](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-block#vpc-block-default-edit).
