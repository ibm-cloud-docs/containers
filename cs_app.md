# Deploying Kubernetes-native apps in clusters
{: #app}

You can use Kubernetes techniques in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to deploy apps in containers and ensure that those apps are up and running at all times. For example, you can perform rolling updates and rollbacks without downtime for your users. Because Kubernetes is an extensible container orchestration platform that does not mandate a specific language or app, you can run various workloads such as stateless, stateful, and data-processing apps that are written in the language of your choice.
{: shortdesc}

## Planning to run apps in clusters
{: #plan_apps}

Before you deploy an app to an {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster, decide how you want to set up your app so that your app can be accessed properly and be integrated with other services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

### What type of Kubernetes objects can I make for my app?
{: #object}

When you prepare your app YAML file, you have many options to increase the app's availability, performance, and security. For example, instead of a single pod, you can use a Kubernetes controller object to manage your workload, such as a replica set, job, or daemon set. For more information about pods and controllers, view the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/). A deployment that manages a replica set of pods is a common use case for an app.
{: shortdesc}

For example, a `kind: Deployment` object is a good choice to deploy an app pod because with it, you can specify a replica set for more availability for your pods.

The following table describes why you might create different types of Kubernetes workload objects.

| Object | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`Pod` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) | A pod is the smallest deployable unit for your workloads, and can hold a single or multiple containers. Similar to containers, pods are designed to be disposable and are often used for unit testing of app features. To avoid downtime for your app, consider deploying pods with a Kubernetes controller, such as a deployment. A deployment helps you to manage multiple pods, replicas, pod scaling, rollouts, and more. |
| [`ReplicaSet` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) | A replica set makes sure that multiple replicas of your pod are running, and reschedules a pod if the pod goes down. You might create a replica set to test how pod scheduling works, but to manage app updates, rollouts, and scaling, create a deployment instead. |
| [`Deployment` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) | A deployment is a controller that manages a pod or [replica set ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) of pod templates. You can create pods or replica sets without a deployment to test app features. For a production-level setup, use deployments to manage app updates, rollouts, and scaling. |
| [`StatefulSet` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) | Similar to deployments, a stateful set is a controller that manages a replica set of pods. Unlike deployments, a stateful set ensures that your pod has a unique network identity that maintains its state across rescheduling. When you want to run workloads in the cloud, try to [design your app to be stateless](/docs/containers?topic=containers-strategy#cloud_workloads) so that your service instances are independent from each other and can fail without a service interruption. However, some apps, such as databases, must be stateful. For those cases, consider to create a stateful set and use [file](/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage#file_statefulset), [block](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#block_statefulset), or [object](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#cos_statefulset) storage as the persistent storage for your stateful set. You can also install [Portworx](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx) on top of your bare metal worker nodes and use Portworx as a highly available software-defined storage solution to manage persistent storage for your stateful set. |
| [`DaemonSet` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) | Use a daemon set when you must run the same pod on every worker node in your cluster. Pods that are managed by a daemon set are automatically scheduled when a worker node is added to a cluster. Typical use cases include log collectors, such as `logstash` or `prometheus`, that collect logs from every worker node to provide insight into the health of a cluster or an app. |
| [`Job` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) | A job ensures that one or more pods run successfully to completion. You might use a job for queues or batch jobs to support parallel processing of separate but related work items, such as a certain number of frames to render, emails to send, and files to convert. To schedule a job to run at certain times, use a [`CronJob` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).|

### How can I add capabilities to my Kubernetes app configuration?
See [Specifying your app requirements in your YAML file](#app_yaml) for descriptions of what you might include in a deployment. The example includes:
* [Replica sets](#replicaset)
* [Labels](#label)
* [Affinity](#affinity)
* [Image policies](#image)
* [Ports](#port)
* [Resource requests and limits](#resourcereq)
* [Liveness and readiness probes](#probe)
* [Services](#app-service) to expose the app service on a port
* [Configmaps](#configmap) to set container environment variables
* [Secrets](#secret) to set container environment variables
* [Persistent volumes](#pv) that are mounted to the container for storage

### What if I want my Kubernetes app configuration to use variables? How do I add these to the YAML?
{: #variables}

To add variable information to your deployments instead of hard-coding the data into the YAML file, you can use a Kubernetes [`ConfigMap` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/) or [`Secret` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) object.
{: shortdesc}

To consume a configmap or secret, you need to mount it to the pod. The configmap or secret is combined with the pod just before the pod is run. You can reuse a deployment spec and image across many apps, but then swap out the customized configmaps and secrets. Secrets in particular can take up a lot of storage on the local node, so plan accordingly.

Both resources define key-value pairs, but you use them for different situations.

<dl>
<dt>Configmap</dt>
<dd>Provide non-sensitive configuration information for workloads that are specified in a deployment. You can use configmaps in three main ways.
<ul><li><strong>File system</strong>: You can mount an entire file or a set of variables to a pod. A file is created for each entry based on the key name contents of the file that are set to the value.</li>
<li><strong>Environment variable</strong>: Dynamically set the environment variable for a container spec.</li>
<li><strong>Command-line argument</strong>: Set the command-line argument that is used in a container spec.</li></ul></dd>

<dt>Secret</dt>
<dd>Provide sensitive information to your workloads, such as follows. Other users of the cluster might have access to the secret, so be sure that you know the secret information can be shared with those users.
<ul><li><strong>Personally identifiable information (PII)</strong>: Store sensitive information such as email addresses or other types of information that are required for company compliance or government regulation in secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Credentials</strong>: Put credentials such as passwords, keys, and tokens in a secret to reduce the risk of accidental exposure. For example, when you [bind a service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding#bind-services) to your cluster, the credentials are stored in a secret.</li></ul></dd>
</dl>

Want to make your secrets even more secured? Ask your cluster admin to [enable {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#keyprotect) in your cluster to encrypt new and existing secrets.
{: tip}

### How can I add IBM services to my app, such as Watson?
See [Adding services to apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-binding#adding_app).

### How can I make sure that my app has the right resources?
When you [specify your app YAML file](#app_yaml), you can add Kubernetes functionalities to your app configuration that help your app get the right resources. In particular, [set resource limits and requests ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/) for each container that is defined in your YAML file.
{: shortdesc}

Additionally, your cluster admin might set up resource controls that can affect your app deployment, such as the following.
*  [Resource quotas ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
*  [Pod priority](/docs/containers?topic=containers-pod_priority#pod_priority)

### How can I access my app?
You can access your app privately within the cluster by [using a `clusterIP` service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#in-cluster).
{: shortdesc}

If you want to expose your app publicly, you have different options that depend on your cluster type.
*  **Free cluster**: You can expose your app by using a [NodePort service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-nodeport#nodeport).
*  **Standard cluster**: You can expose your app by using a [NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#external).
*  **Cluster that is made private by using Calico**: You can expose your app by using a [NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#private_both_vlans). You also must use a Calico preDNAT network policy to block the public node ports.
*  **Private VLAN-only standard cluster**: You can expose your app by using a [NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#plan_private_vlan). You also must open the port for the service's private IP address in your firewall.

### How can I automate my app deployment?
After your cluster is fully deployed, you can set up a continuous delivery and continuous integration pipeline for your cluster to automate the deployment and testing of your containerized apps. With {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipelinelong}}, you can choose between pre-defined DevOps templates that help you deploy Kubernetes-native apps and Helm charts, run vulnerability tests, A/B tests, and set up automatic health checks and alerting. For more information, see [Setting up a continuous delivery pipeline for a cluster](#continuous-delivery-pipeline).

### After I deploy my app, how can I monitor its health?
You can set up {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [logging and monitoring](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#health) for your cluster. You might also choose to integrate with a third-party [logging or monitoring service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-supported_integrations#health_services).
{: shortdesc}

### How can I keep my app up-to-date?
If you want to dynamically add and remove apps in response to workload usage, see [Scaling apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#app_scaling).
{: shortdesc}

If you want to manage updates to your app, see [Managing rolling deployments](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#app_rolling).

### How can I control who has access to my app deployments?
The account and cluster administrators can control access on many different levels: the cluster, Kubernetes namespace, pod, and container.
{: shortdesc}

With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM, you can assign permissions to individual users, groups, or service accounts at the cluster-instance level.  You can scope cluster access down further by restricting users to particular namespaces within the cluster. For more information, see [Assigning cluster access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#users).

To control access at the pod level, you can configure [pod security policies (PSPs)](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp).

Within the app deployment YAML, you can set the security context for a pod or container. For more information, review the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

Want to control access at the application level? To create a sign-on flow that you can update at any time without changing your app code, try using [{{site.data.keyword.appid_long_notm}}](/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-getting-started).

## Planning highly available deployments
{: #highly_available_apps}

The more widely you distribute your setup across multiple worker nodes and clusters, the less likely your users are to experience downtime with your app.
{: shortdesc}

Review the following potential app setups that are ordered with increasing degrees of availability.

![Stages of high availability for an app](images/cs_app_ha_roadmap-mz.png)

1.  A deployment with n+2 pods that are managed by a replica set in a single node in a single zone cluster.
2.  A deployment with n+2 pods that are managed by a replica set and spread across multiple nodes (anti-affinity) in a single zone cluster.
3.  A deployment with n+2 pods that are managed by a replica set and spread across multiple nodes (anti-affinity) in a multizone cluster across zones.

You can also [connect multiple clusters in different regions with a global load balancer](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#multiple_clusters) to increase the high availability.

### Increasing the availability of your app
{: #increase_availability}

Consider the following options to increase availability of your app.
{: shortdesc}

<dl>
  <dt>Use deployments and replica sets to deploy your app and its dependencies</dt>
    <dd><p>A deployment is a Kubernetes resource that you can use to declare all of the components of your app and its dependencies. With deployments, you don't have to write down all of the steps and instead can focus on your app.</p>
    <p>When you deploy more than one pod, a replica set is automatically created for your deployments that monitors the pods and assures that the specified number of pods is up and running at all times. When a pod goes down, the replica set replaces the unresponsive pod with a new one.</p>
    <p>You can use a deployment to define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time. When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether or not the revision is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.</p>
    <p>With deployments, you can concurrently deploy multiple revisions with different flags. For example, you can test a deployment first before you decide to push it to production.</p>
    <p>By using Deployments, you can track any deployed revisions. You can use this history to roll back to a previous version if you encounter that your updates are not working as expected.</p></dd>
  <dt>Include enough replicas for your app's workload, plus two</dt>
    <dd>To make your app even more highly available and more resilient to failure, consider including extra replicas than the minimum to handle the expected workload. Extra replicas can handle the workload in case a pod crashes and the replica set did not yet recover the crashed pod. For protection against two simultaneous failures, include two extra replicas. This setup is an N+2 pattern, where N is the number of replicas to handle the incoming workload and +2 is an extra two replicas. As long as your cluster has enough space, you can have as many pods as you want.</dd>
  <dt>Spread pods across multiple nodes (anti-affinity)</dt>
    <dd><p>When you create your deployment, each pod can be deployed to the same worker node. This is known as affinity, or co-location. To protect your app against worker node failure, you can configure your deployment to spread your pods across multiple worker nodes by using the <code>podAntiAffinity</code> option with your standard clusters. You can define two types of pod anti-affinity: preferred or required.
      <p>For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Assigning Pods to Nodes</a>.</p>
      <p>For an example of affinity in an app deployment, see [Making your app deployment YAML file](#app_yaml).</p>
      </dd>
    </dd>
<dt>Distribute pods across multiple zones or regions</dt>
  <dd><p>To protect your app from a zone failure, you can create multiple clusters in separate zones or add zones to a worker pool in a multizone cluster. Multizone clusters are available only in [certain metro areas](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones), such as Dallas. If you create multiple clusters in separate zones, you must [set up a global load balancer](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#multiple_clusters).</p>
  <p>When you use a replica set and specify pod anti-affinity, Kubernetes spreads your app pods across the nodes. If your nodes are in multiple zones, the pods are spread across the zones, increasing the availability of your app. If you want to limit your apps to run only in one zone, you can configure pod affinity, or create and label a worker pool in one zone. For more information, see [High availability for multizone clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#ha_clusters).</p>
  <p><strong>In a multizone cluster deployment, are my app pods distributed evenly across the nodes?</strong></p>
  <p>The pods are evenly distributed across zones, but not always across nodes. For example, if you have a cluster with one node in each of three zones and deploy a replica set of six pods, then each node gets two pods. However, if you have a cluster with two nodes in each of three zones and deploy a replica set of six pods, each zone schedules two pods, and might schedule one pod per node or might not. For more control over scheduling, you can [set pod affinity ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node).</p>
  <p><strong>If a zone goes down, how are pods rescheduled onto the remaining nodes in the other zones?</strong></br>It depends on your scheduling policy that you used in the deployment. If you included [node-specific pod affinity ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-beta-feature), your pods are not rescheduled. If you did not, pods are created on available worker nodes in other zones, but they might not be balanced. For example, the two pods might be spread across the two available nodes, or they might both be scheduled onto one node with available capacity. Similarly, when the unavailable zone returns, pods are not automatically deleted and rebalanced across nodes. If you want the pods to be rebalanced across zones after the zone is back up, consider using the [Kubernetes descheduler ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/descheduler).</p>
  <p><strong>Tip</strong>: In multizone clusters, try to keep your worker node capacity at 50% per zone so that enough capacity is left to protect your cluster against a zonal failure.</p>
  <p><strong>What if I want to spread my app across regions?</strong></br>To protect your app from a region failure, create a second cluster in another region, [set up a global load balancer](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#multiple_clusters) to connect your clusters, and use a deployment YAML to deploy a duplicate replica set with [pod anti-affinity ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/) for your app.</p>
  <p><strong>What if my apps need persistent storage?</strong></p>
  <p>Use a cloud service such as [{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}](/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-getting-started-with-cloudant) or [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started).</p></dd>
</dl>

## Specifying your app requirements in your YAML file
{: #app_yaml}

In Kubernetes, you describe your app in a YAML file that declares the configuration of the Kubernetes object. The Kubernetes API server then processes the YAML file and stores the configuration and required state of the object in the etcd data store. The Kubernetes scheduler schedules your workloads onto the worker nodes within your cluster, taking into account the specification in your YAML file, any cluster policies that the admin sets, and available cluster capacity.
{: shortdesc}

Review a copy of the [complete YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/deploy-apps-clusters/deploy_wasliberty.yaml). Then, review the following sections to understand how you can enhance your app deployment.

* [Replica sets](#replicaset)
* [Labels](#label)
* [Affinity](#affinity)
* [Image policies](#image)
* [Ports](#port)
* [Resource requests and limits](#resourcereq)
* [Liveness and readiness probes](#probe)
* [Services](#app-service) to expose the app service on a port
* [Configmaps](#configmap) to set container environment variables
* [Secrets](#secret) to set container environment variables
* [Persistent volumes](#pv) that are mounted to the container for storage
* [Next steps](#nextsteps)
* [Complete example YAML](#yaml-example)

<dl>
<dt>Basic deployment metadata</dt>
  <dd><p>Use the appropriate API version for the [kind of Kubernetes object](#object) that you deploy. The API version determines the supported features for the Kubernetes object that are available to you. The name that you give in the metadata is the object's name, not its label. You use the name when interacting with your object, such as `kubectl get deployment <name>`.</p>
  <p><pre class="codeblock"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wasliberty</code></pre></p></dd>

<dt id="replicaset">Replica set</dt>
  <dd><p>To increase the availability of your app, you can specify a replica set in your deployment. In a replica set, you define how many instances of your app that you want to deploy. Replica sets are managed and monitored by your Kubernetes deployment. If one app instance goes down, Kubernetes automatically spins up a new instance of your app to maintain the specified number of app instances.</p>
  <p><pre class="codeblock"><code>spec:
  replicas: 3</pre></code></p></dd>

<dt id="label">Labels</dt>
  <dd><p>With [labels](/docs/containers?topic=containers-strategy#deploy_organize), you can mark different types of resources in your cluster with the same `key: value` pair. Then, you can specify the selector to match the label so that you can build upon these other resources. If you plan to expose your app publicly, you must use a label that matches the selector that you specify in the service. In the example, the deployment spec uses the template that matches the label `app: wasliberty.`</p>
  <p>You can retrieve objects that are labeled in your cluster, such as to see `staging` or `production` components. For example, list all resources with an `env: production` label across all namespaces in the cluster. <strong>Note:</strong> You need access to all namespaces to run this command.<pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get all -l env=production --all-namespaces</code></pre></p>
  <ul><li>For more information about labels, see the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/).</li>
  <li>To apply labels to worker nodes, [create your worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#add_pool) with labels or [update an existing worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#worker_pool_labels).</li>
  <li>For a more detailed example, see [Deploying apps to specific worker nodes by using labels](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#node_affinity).</li></ul>
  <p><pre class="codeblock"><code>selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: wasliberty
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: wasliberty</pre></code></p></dd>

<dt id="affinity">Affinity</dt>
  <dd><p>Specify affinity (co-location) when you want more control over which worker nodes the pods are scheduled on. Affinity affects the pods only at scheduling time. For example, to spread the deployment across worker nodes instead of allowing pods to schedule on the same node, use the <code>podAntiAffinity</code> option with your standard clusters. You can define two types of pod anti-affinity: preferred or required.</p>
  <p>For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Assigning Pods to Nodes</a>.</p>
  <ul><li><strong>Required anti-affinity</strong>: You can deploy only the number of replicas that you have worker nodes for. For example, if you have three worker nodes in your cluster but you define five replicas in your YAML file, then only three replicas deploy. Each replica lives on a different worker node. The leftover two replicas remain pending. If you add another worker node to your cluster, then one of the leftover replicas deploys to the new worker node automatically. If a worker node fails, the pod does not reschedule because the affinity policy is required. For an example YAML with required, see <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/deploy-apps-clusters/liberty_requiredAntiAffinity.yaml" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Liberty app with required pod anti-affinity.</a></li>
  <li><strong>Preferred anti-affinity</strong>: You can deploy your pods to nodes with available capacity, which provides more flexibility for your workload. When possible, the pods are scheduled on different worker nodes. For example, if you have three worker nodes with enough capacity in your cluster, it can schedule the five replica pods across the nodes. However, if you add two more worker nodes to your cluster, the affinity rule does not force the two extra pods that are running on the existing nodes to reschedule onto the free node.</li>
  <li><strong>Worker node affinity</strong>: You can configure your deployment to run on only certain worker nodes, such as bare metal. For more information, see [Deploying apps to specific worker nodes by using labels](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#node_affinity).</li></ul>
  <p>Example for preferred anti-affinity:</p>
  <p><pre class="codeblock"><code>spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:

          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname</pre></code></p></dd>

<dt id="image">Container image</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Specify the image that you want to use for your containers, the location of the image, and the image pull policy. If you do not specify an image tag, by default it pulls the image that is tagged `latest`.</p>
  <p>**Attention**: Avoid using the latest tag for production workloads. You might not have tested your workload with the latest image if you are using a public or shared repository, such as Docker Hub or {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}}.</p>

  <li>List the IBM images.<pre class="pre"><code>ibmcloud cr images --include-ibm</code></pre></li></ol>
  <p>The default `imagePullPolicy` is set to `IfNotPresent`, which pulls the image only if it does not exist locally. If you want the image to be pulled every time that the container starts, specify the `imagePullPolicy: Always`.</p>

<dt id="port">Port for the app's service</dt>
  <dd><p>Select a container port to open the app's services on. To see which port needs to be opened, refer to your app specs or Dockerfile. The port is accessible from the private network, but not from a public network connection. To expose the app publicly, you must create a NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service.

<dt id="resourcereq">Resource requests and limits</dt>
  <dd><p>As a cluster admin, you can make sure that teams that share a cluster don't take up more than their fair share of compute resources (memory and CPU) by creating a [<code>ResourceQuota</code> object ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) for each Kubernetes namespace in the cluster. If the cluster admin sets a compute resource quota, then each container within the deployment template must specify resource requests and limits for memory and CPU, otherwise the pod creation fails.</p>
  <p><ol><li>Check whether a resource quota is set for a namespace.<pre class="pre"><code>kubectl get quota --namespace=<namespace></code></pre></li>
  <li>See what the quota limits are.<pre class="pre"><code>kubectl describe quota <quota_name> --namespace=<namespace></code></pre></li></ol></p>
  <p>Even if no resource quota is set, you can include resource requests and limits in your deployment to improve the management of worker node resources.</p><p class="note">If a container exceeds its limit, the container might be restarted or fail. If a container exceeds a request, its pod might be evicted if the worker node runs out of that resource that is exceeded. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Pods repeatedly fail to restart or are unexpectedly removed](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_clusters#pods_fail).</p>
  <p>**Request**: The minimum amount of the resource that the scheduler reserves for the container to use. If the amount is equal to the limit, the request is guaranteed. If the amount is less than the limit, the request is still guaranteed, but the scheduler can use the difference between the request and the limit to fulfill the resources of other containers.</p>
  <p>**Limit**: The maximum amount of the resource that the container can consume. If the total amount of resources that is used across the containers exceeds the amount available on the worker node, containers can be evicted to free up space. To prevent eviction, set the resource request equal to the limit of the container. If no limit is specified, the default is the worker node's capacity.</p>

<dt id="probe">Liveness and readiness probes</dt>
  <dd><p>By default, Kubernetes sends traffic to your app pods after all containers in the pod start, and restarts containers when they crash. However, you can set health checks to improve the robustness of service traffic routing. For example, your app might have a startup delay. The app processes might begin before the entire app is completely ready, which can affect responses especially when scaling up across many instances. With health checks, you can let your system can know whether your app is running and ready to receive requests. By setting these probes, you can also help prevent downtime when you perform a [rolling update](#app_rolling) of your app. You can set two types of health checks: liveness and readiness probes.</p>
  <p>**Liveness probe**: Set up a liveness probe to check whether the container is running. If the probe fails, the container is restarted. If the container does not specify a liveness probe, the probe succeeds because it assumes that the container is alive when the container is in a **Running** status.</p>
  <p>**Readiness probe**: Set up a readiness probe to check whether the container is ready to receive requests and external traffic. If the probe fails, the pod's IP address is removed as a usable IP address for services that match the pod, but the container is not restarted. Setting a readiness probe with an initial delay is especially important if your app takes a while to start up. Before the initial delay, the probe does not start, giving your container time to come up. If the container does not provide a readiness probe, the probe succeeds because it assumes that the container is alive when the container is in a **Running** status.</p>
  <p>You can set up the probes as commands, HTTP requests, or TCP sockets. The example uses HTTP requests. Give the liveness probe more time than the readiness probe. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/).</p>

<dt id="app-service">Exposing the app service</dt>
  <dd><p>You can create a service that exposes your app. In the `spec` section, make sure to match the `port` and label values with the ones that you used in the deployment. The service exposes objects that match the label, such as `app: wasliberty` in the following example.</p>
  <ul><li>By default, a service uses [`ClusterIP` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/), which makes the service accessible only within the cluster but not outside the cluster.</li>
  <li>You can create a NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service to expose the app publicly. These services have two IPs, one external and one internal. When traffic is received on the external IP, it is forwarded to the internal cluster IP. Then, from the internal cluster IP, the traffic is routed to the container IP of the app.</li>
  <li>The example uses `NodePort` to expose the service outside the cluster. For more information about how to set up external access, see [Choosing a NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#external).</li></ul>

  <p class="important">If you have a requirement to deploy `hostNetwork` pods to listen on specific ports or to use a `hostPort` to expose your app pods on a specific port on the worker node, use a port in the `11000-11200` range. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} designates the `11000-11200` port range on worker nodes for this purpose to avoid conflicts with local ports and other ports that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses. Because `hostNetwork` pods and `hostPorts` refer to a particular worker node IP address, the pods are limited to run only on that worker node. If something unanticipated happens, such as the worker node being removed or running out of resources, your pod cannot be rescheduled. If you want to expose a pod’s port on the worker node, consider using a [`NodePort` service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-nodeport) instead.

## Managing Kubernetes configuration files for reuse in multiple environments with Kustomize
{: #kustomize}

As part of a [twelve-factor ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://12factor.net/), cloud-native app, you want to maintain dev-to-prod parity by setting up a continuous development and delivery pipeline that uses a common, version-controlled codebase source. In your codebase repositories, you store your Kubernetes resource configuration manifest files, often in YAML format. You can use the Kubernetes project [Kustomize ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kustomize.io/) both to standardize and customize your deployments across multiple environments.
{: shortdesc}

For example, you can set up a base `kustomization` YAML to declare Kubernetes objects such as deployments and PVCs that are shared in your development, testing, and production environments. Next, you can set up separate `kustomization` YAMLs that have customized configurations for each environment, such as more replicas in production than testing. These customized YAMLs can then overlay, or build on, the shared base YAML so that you can manage environments that are mostly identical except for a few overlay configuration differences that you source-control. For more information about Kustomize such as a glossary and FAQs, check out the [Kustomize docs ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/docs).

Before you begin:
*   [Create](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters_ui) or [update](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update) to a cluster that runs Kubernetes version 1.14 or later.
*   Make sure that your [`kubectl` version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) matches your cluster version.
*   [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To set up configuration files with Kustomize:
1.  [Install the `kustomize` tool ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md).
    *   For macOS, you can use the `brew` package manager.
        ```
        brew install kustomize
        ```
        {: pre}
    *   For Windows, you can use the `chocolatey` package manager.
        ```
        choco install kustomize
        ```
        {: pre}
2.  Create a directory for your app in a version control system, such as Git.
    ```
    git init ~/<my_app>
    ```
    {: pre}
3.  Create your repo structure for your `kustomize` [`base` ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/glossary.md#base) directory, [`overlay`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/glossary.md#overlay) directory, and environment directories such as staging and production. In the subsequent steps, you set up these repos for use with `kustomize`.
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/base &&
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/overlay &&
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/overlay/staging &&
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/overlay/prod
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example repo structure:
    ```
    .
    ├── base
    └── overlay
        ├── prod
        └── staging
    ```
    {: screen}
4.  Set up the `base` repo.
    1.  Navigate to the base repo.
        ```
        cd ~/<my_app>/base
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  Create an initial set of Kubernetes configuration YAML files for your app deployment. You might use the `wasliberty` [YAML example](#yaml-example) to create a deployment, service, config map, and persistent volume claim.
    3.  Create a [`kustomization` file ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize#1-make-a-kustomization-file) that specifies the base configuration to be applied across environments. The `kustomization` file must include the list of Kubernetes resource configuration YAMLs that are stored in the same `base` repo. In the `kustomization` file, you can also add configurations that apply to all the resource YAMLs in the base repo, such as a prefix or suffix that is appended to all the resource names, a label, the existing namespace all the resources are created in, secrets, configmaps, and more.
        ```
        apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Kustomization
        namespace: wasliberty
        namePrefix: kustomtest-
        nameSuffix: -v2
        commonLabels:
          app: kustomized-wasliberty
        resources:
        - deployment.yaml
        - service.yaml
        - pvc.yaml
        - configmap.yaml
        - secret.yaml
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        The names of the `resources` YAMLs must match the names of the other files in the `base` repo. You might include multiple configurations in the same file, but in the example, the configurations are separate files such as `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `pvc.yaml`.

    4.  Build your resource YAML files with the configurations that you defined in the `kustomization` base YAML file. The resources are built by combining the configurations in the `kustomization` and resource YAMLs together. The combined YAML files are returned in `stdout` in the terminal output. Use this same command to build any subsequent changes that you make to the `kustomization` YAML, such adding a label.
        ```
        kustomize build
        ```
        {: pre}
5.  Set up your overlay repo with unique `kustomization` YAML files for each of your environments, such as staging and prod.
    1.  In the staging repo, create a `kustomization.yaml` file. Add any configurations that are unique to staging, such as a label, image tag, or YAML for a new component that you want to test out.
        ```
        apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Kustomization
        namePrefix: staging-
        commonLabels:
          env: staging
          owner: TeamA
        bases:
        - ../../base
        patchesStrategicMerge:
        - configmap.yaml
        - new_staging_resource.yaml
        resources:
        - new_staging_resource.yaml
        ```

    2.  Build your staging overlay configuration files.
        ```
        kustomize build overlay/staging
        ```
        {: pre}
    3.  Repeat these steps to create your prod overlay `kustomization` and other configuration YAML files. For example, you might increase the number of replicas in your `deployment.yaml` so that your prod environment can handle more user requests.
    4.  Review your `kustomize` repo structure to make sure that it includes all the YAML configuration files that you need. The structure might look similar to the following example.
        ```
        ├── base
        │   ├── configmap.yaml
        │   ├── deployment.yaml
        │   ├── kustomization.yaml
        │   ├── pvc.yaml
        │   ├── secret.yaml
        │   └── service.yaml
        └── overlay
            ├── prod
            │   ├── deployment.yaml
            │   ├── kustomization.yaml
            │   └── new_prod_resource.yaml
            └── staging
                ├── configmap.yaml
                ├── kustomization.yaml
                └── new_staging_resource.yaml
        ```
        {: screen}
6.  Apply the Kubernetes resources for the environment that you want to deploy. The following example uses the staging repo.
    1.  Navigate to the staging overlay directory. If you did not build your resources in the previous step, create them now.
        ```
        cd overlay/staging && kustomize build
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  Apply the Kubernetes resources to your cluster. Include the `-k` flag and the directory where the `kustomization` file is located. For example, if you are already in the staging directory, include `../staging` to mark the path to the directory.
        ```
        kubectl apply -k ../staging
        ```
        {: pre}
        Example output:
        ```
        configmap/staging-kustomtest-configmap-v2 created
        secret/staging-kustomtest-secret-v2 created
        service/staging-kustomtest-service-v2 created
        deployment.apps/staging-kustomtest-deployment-v2 created
        job.batch/staging-pi created
        persistentvolumeclaim/staging-kustomtest-pvc-v2 created
        ```
    3.  Check to make sure that the staging-unique changes are applied. For example, if you added a `staging-` prefix, the pods and other resources that are created include this prefix in their name.
        ```
        kubectl get -k ../staging
        ```
        {: pre}
        Example output:
        ```

        ```
        {: screen}
    4.  Repeat these steps for each environment that you want to build.
7.  **Optional**: Clean up your environment by removing all the resources that you applied with Kustomize.
    ```
    kubectl delete -k <directory>
    ```
    {: pre}
    Example output:
    ```
    configmap "staging-kustomtest-configmap-v2" deleted
    secret "staging-kustomtest-secret-v2" deleted
    service "staging-kustomtest-service-v2" deleted
    deployment.apps "staging-kustomtest-deployment-v2" deleted
    job.batch "staging-pi" deleted
    persistentvolumeclaim "staging-kustomtest-pvc-v2" deleted
    ```

## Launching the Kubernetes dashboard
{: #cli_dashboard}

Open a Kubernetes dashboard on your local system to view information about a cluster and its worker nodes. [In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](#db_gui), you can access the dashboard with a convenient one-click button. [With the CLI](#db_cli), you can access the dashboard or use the steps in an automation process such as for a CI/CD pipeline.
{:shortdesc}

Do you have so many resources and users in your cluster that the Kubernetes dashboard is a little slow? For clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.12 or later, your cluster admin can scale the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment by running `kubectl -n kube-system scale deploy kubernetes-dashboard --replicas=3`.
{: tip}

To check the logs for individual app pods, you can run `kubectl logs <pod name>`. Do not use the Kubernetes dashboard to stream logs for your pods, which might cause a disruption in your access to the Kubernetes dashboard.
{: important}

Before you begin:
* Make sure that you are assigned a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources.
* To [launch the Kubernetes dashboard from the console](#db_gui), you must be assigned a [platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform). If you are assigned only a service role but no platform role, [launch the Kubernetes dashboard from the CLI](#db_cli).
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

You can use the default port or set your own port to launch the Kubernetes dashboard for a cluster.

**Launching the Kubernetes dashboard from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console**
{: #db_gui}

1.  Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
2.  From the menu bar, select the account that you want to use.
3.  From the menu ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu icon"), click **Kubernetes**.
4.  On the **Clusters** page, click the cluster that you want to access.
5.  From the cluster detail page, click the **Kubernetes Dashboard** button.

</br>

**Launching the Kubernetes dashboard from the CLI**
{: #db_cli}

1.  Get your credentials for Kubernetes.

    ```
    kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.users[0].user.auth-provider.config.id-token}'
    ```
    {: pre}

2.  Copy the **id-token** value that is shown in the output.

3.  Set the proxy with the default port number.

    ```
    kubectl proxy
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001
    ```
    {: screen}

4.  Sign in to the dashboard.

  1.  In your browser, navigate to the following URL:

      ```
      http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/
      ```
      {: codeblock}

  2.  In the sign-on page, select the **Token** authentication method.

  3.  Then, paste the **id-token** value that you previously copied into the **Token** field and click **SIGN IN**.

When you are done with the Kubernetes dashboard, use `CTRL+C` to exit the `proxy` command. After you exit, the Kubernetes dashboard is no longer available. Run the `proxy` command to restart the Kubernetes dashboard.

[Next, you can run a configuration file from the dashboard.](#app_ui)

<br />


## Deploying apps with the Kubernetes dashboard
{: #app_ui}

When you deploy an app to your cluster by using the Kubernetes dashboard, a deployment resource automatically creates, updates, and manages the pods in your cluster. For more information about using the dashboard, see [the Kubernetes docs ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/).
{:shortdesc}

Do you have so many resources and users in your cluster that the Kubernetes dashboard is a little slow? For clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.12 or later, your cluster admin can scale the `kubernetes-dashboard` deployment by running `kubectl -n kube-system scale deploy kubernetes-dashboard --replicas=3`.
{: tip}

Before you begin:

-   [Install the required CLIs](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_install).
-   [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
-   Make sure that you are assigned a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources.
-   To [launch the Kubernetes dashboard from the console](#db_gui), you must be assigned a [platform role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform). If you are assigned only a service role but no platform role, [launch the Kubernetes dashboard from the CLI](#db_cli).

To deploy your app:

1.  Open the Kubernetes [dashboard](#cli_dashboard) and click **+ Create**.
2.  Enter your app details in 1 of 2 ways.
  * Select **Specify app details below** and enter the details.
  * Select **Upload a YAML or JSON file** to upload your app [configuration file ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/).

  Need help with your configuration file? Check out this [example YAML file ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/deploy-apps-clusters/deploy-ibmliberty.yaml). In this example, a container is deployed from the **ibmliberty** image in the US-South region. Learn more about [securing your personal information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#pi) when you work with Kubernetes resources.
  {: tip}

3.  Verify that you successfully deployed your app in one of the following ways.
  * In the Kubernetes dashboard, click **Deployments**. A list of successful deployments is displayed.
  * If your app is [publicly available](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#public_access), navigate to the cluster overview page in your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} dashboard. Copy the subdomain, which is located in the cluster summary section and paste it into a browser to view your app.

<br />


## Deploying apps with the CLI
{: #app_cli}

After a cluster is created, you can deploy an app into that cluster by using the Kubernetes CLI.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   Install the required [CLIs](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_install).
-   [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
-   Make sure that you are assigned a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources in the namespace.

To deploy your app:

1.  Create a configuration file based on [Kubernetes best practices ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/). Generally, a configuration file contains configuration details for each of the resources you are creating in Kubernetes. Your script might include one or more of the following sections:

    -   [Deployment ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/): Defines the creation of pods and replica sets. A pod includes an individual containerized app and replica sets control multiple instances of pods.

    -   [Service ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/): Provides front-end access to pods by using a worker node or load balancer public IP address, or a public Ingress route.

    -   [Ingress ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/): Specifies a type of load balancer that provides routes to access your app publicly.

    Learn more about [securing your personal information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#pi) when you work with Kubernetes resources.

2.  Run the configuration file in a cluster's context.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f config.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3.  If you made your app publicly available by using a nodeport service, a load balancer service, or Ingress, verify that you can access the app.

<br />


## Deploying apps to specific worker nodes by using labels
{: #node_affinity}

When you deploy an app, the app pods indiscriminately deploy to various worker nodes in your cluster. In some cases, you might want to restrict the worker nodes that the app pods to deploy to. For example, you might want app pods to deploy to only worker nodes in a certain worker pool because those worker nodes are on bare metal machines. To designate the worker nodes that app pods must deploy to, add an affinity rule to your app deployment.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:
*   [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
*   Make sure that you are assigned a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources in the namespace.

To deploy apps to specific worker nodes:

1.  Get the ID of the worker pool that you want to deploy app pods to.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

2.  List the worker nodes that are in the worker pool, and note one of the **Private IP** addresses.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

3.  Describe the worker node. In the **Labels** output, note the worker pool ID label, `ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/worker-pool-id`.

    <p class="tip">The steps in this topic use a worker pool ID to deploy app pods only to worker nodes within that worker pool. To deploy app pods to specific worker nodes by using a different label, note this label instead. For example, to deploy app pods only to worker nodes on a specific private VLAN, use the `privateVLAN=` label.</p>

    ```
    kubectl describe node <worker_node_private_IP>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    Name:               10.xxx.xx.xxx
    Roles:              <none>
    Labels:             arch=amd64

    Annotations:        node.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=0
    ...
    ```
    {: screen}

4. [Add an affinity rule ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity-beta-feature) for the worker pool ID label to the app deployment.

    Example YAML:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: with-node-affinity
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          affinity:
            nodeAffinity:
              requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                nodeSelectorTerms:
                - matchExpressions:
                  - key: ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/worker-pool-id
                    operator: In
                    values:
                    - <worker_pool_ID>
    ...
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    In the **affinity** section of the example YAML, `ibm-cloud.kubernetes.io/worker-pool-id` is the `key` and `<worker_pool_ID>` is the `value`.

5. Apply the updated deployment configuration file.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f with-node-affinity.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Verify that the app pods deployed to the correct worker nodes.

    1. List the pods in your cluster.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -o wide
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        NAME                   READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE       IP               NODE
        cf-py-d7b7d94db-vp8pq  1/1       Running             0          15d       172.30.xxx.xxx   10.176.48.78
        ```
        {: screen}

    2. In the output, identify a pod for your app. Note the **NODE** private IP address of the worker node that the pod is on.

        In the previous example output, the app pod `cf-py-d7b7d94db-vp8pq` is on a worker node with the IP address `10.xxx.xx.xxx`.

    3. List the worker nodes in the worker pool that you designated in your app deployment.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:

        ```
        ID                                                 Public IP       Private IP     Machine Type      State    Status  Zone    Version
        kube-dal10-crb20b637238bb471f8b4b8b881bbb4962-w7   169.xx.xxx.xxx  10.176.48.78   b3c.4x16          normal   Ready   dal10   1.8.6_1504
        kube-dal10-crb20b637238bb471f8b4b8b881bbb4962-w8   169.xx.xxx.xxx  10.176.48.83   b3c.4x16          normal   Ready   dal10   1.8.6_1504
        kube-dal12-crb20b637238bb471f8b4b8b881bbb4962-w9   169.xx.xxx.xxx  10.176.48.69   b3c.4x16          normal   Ready   dal12   1.8.6_1504
        ```
        {: screen}

        If you created an app affinity rule based on another factor, get that value instead. For example, to verify that the app pod deployed to a worker node on a specific VLAN, view the VLAN that the worker node is on by running `ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker <worker_ID>`.
        {: tip}

    4. In the output, verify that the worker node with the private IP address that you identified in the previous step is deployed in this worker pool.

## Deploying an app on a GPU machine
{: #gpu_app}

If you have a [bare metal graphics processing unit (GPU) machine type](/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes#planning_worker_nodes), you can schedule mathematically intensive workloads onto the worker node. For example, you might run a 3D app that uses the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform to share the processing load across the GPU and CPU to increase performance.

In the following steps, you learn how to deploy workloads that require the GPU. You can also [deploy apps](#app_ui) that don't need to process their workloads across both the GPU and CPU. After, you might find it useful to play around with mathematically intensive workloads such as the [TensorFlow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning framework with [this Kubernetes demo ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/tree/master/examples/ml/tensorflow).

Before you begin:
* [Create a bare metal GPU machine type](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters_ui). This process can take more than one business day to complete.
* Make sure that you are assigned a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources in the namespace.

To execute a workload on a GPU machine:
1.  Create a YAML file. In this example, a `Job` YAML manages batch-like workloads by making a short-lived pod that runs until the command that it is scheduled to complete successfully terminates.

    For GPU workloads, you must always provide the `resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu` field in the YAML specification.
    {: note}

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: batch/v1

    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

2.  Apply the YAML file. For example:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f nvidia-smi.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3.  Check the job pod by filtering your pods by the `nvidia-sim` label. Verify that the **STATUS** is **Completed**.

    ```
    kubectl get pod -a -l 'name in (nvidia-sim)'
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    NAME                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    nvidia-smi-ppkd4      0/1       Completed   0          36s
    ```
    {: screen}

4.  Describe the pod to see how the GPU device plug-in scheduled the pod.
    * In the `Limits` and `Requests` fields, see that the resource limit that you specified matches the request that the device plug-in automatically set.
    * In the events, verify that the pod is assigned to your GPU worker node.

    ```
    kubectl describe pod nvidia-smi-ppkd4
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    Name:           nvidia-smi-ppkd4

    ...
    ```
    {: screen}

5.  To verify that the job used the GPU to compute its workload, you can check the logs. The `[ "/usr/test/nvidia-smi" ]` command from the job queried the GPU device state on the GPU worker node.

    ```
    kubectl logs nvidia-sim-ppkd4
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```

    In this example, you see that both GPUs were used to execute the job because both the GPUs were scheduled in the worker node. If the limit is set to 1, only 1 GPU is shown.

## Scaling apps
{: #app_scaling}

With Kubernetes, you can enable [horizontal pod autoscaling ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) to automatically increase or decrease the number of instances of your apps based on CPU.
{:shortdesc}

Looking for information about scaling Cloud Foundry applications? Check out [IBM Auto-Scaling for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/services/Auto-Scaling?topic=Auto-Scaling-get-started). Want to scale your worker nodes instead of your pods? Check out the [cluster autoscaler](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca#ca).
{: tip}

Before you begin:
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
- Make sure that you are assigned a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources in the namespace.

Steps:

1.  Deploy your app to a cluster from the CLI. When you deploy your app, you must request CPU.

    ```
    kubectl run <app_name> --image=<image> --requests=cpu=<cpu> --expose --port=<port_number>
    ```
    {: pre}

    <table summary="A table that describes in Column 1 the Kubectl command options and in Column 2 how to fill out those options.">

    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><code>--image</code></td>
    <td>The application that you want to deploy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>--request=cpu</code></td>
    <td>The required CPU for the container, which is specified in millicores. As an example, <code>--requests=200m</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>--expose</code></td>
    <td>When true, creates an external service.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>--port</code></td>
    <td>The port where your app is available externally.</td>
    </tr></tbody></table>

    For more complex deployments, you might need to create a [configuration file](#app_cli).
    {: tip}

2.  Create an autoscaler and define your policy. For more information about working with the `kubectl autoscale` command, see [the Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#autoscale).

    ```
    kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment_name> --cpu-percent=<percentage> --min=<min_value> --max=<max_value>

## Managing rolling deployments to update your apps
{: #app_rolling}

You can manage the rollout of your app changes in an automated and controlled fashion for workloads with a pod template such as deployments. If your rollout isn't going according to plan, you can roll back your deployment to the previous revision.
{:shortdesc}

Want to prevent downtime during your rolling update? Be sure to specify a [readiness probe in your deployment](#probe) so that the rollout proceeds to the next app pod after the most recently updated pod is ready.
{: tip}

Before you begin:
*   [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
*   Create a [deployment](#app_cli).
*   Make sure that you have a [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) that grants the appropriate Kubernetes RBAC role so that you can work with Kubernetes resources in the namespace.

To manage rolling updates to your apps:
1.  To make sure that your deployments are marked as ready only when the container is running and ready to service requests, add [liveness and readiness probes to your deployment](#probe).

2.  Update your deployment to include a rolling update strategy that specifies the maximum surge and unavailable pods or percentage of pods during the update.

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:  
      name: nginx-test
    spec:
      replicas: 10
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          service: http-server
      minReadySeconds: 5
      progressDeadlineSeconds: 600
      strategy:
        type: RollingUpdate  
        rollingUpdate:    
          maxUnavailable: 50%
          maxSurge: 2
    ...
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    <table summary="A table that describes in Column 1 the YAML file fields and in Column 2 how to fill out those fields.">
    <caption>YAML components</caption>
    <thead>
    <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.minReadySeconds</code></td>
    <td>By default, deployments wait until the pod is marked as `ready` to continue with the rollout. If you notice that the deployment continues to create pods even though your app in the most recent pod is not yet ready, use this field to slow down the deployment rollout. For example, if you specify `5`, the deployment waits for 5 seconds after the pod is `ready` before it creates the next pod.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.progressDeadlineSeconds</code></td>
    <td>Set a timeout in seconds before a deployment is considered failed. For example, without a timeout, if your new app version has a bug and hangs immediately, the rollout cannot continue because the pod never reaches a `ready` state. If you set this timeout to `600` seconds, then if any phase of the rollout fails to progress for 10 minutes, the deployment is marked as failed and the rollout stops.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.strategy.type</code></td>
    <td>Specify the `RollingUpdate` strategy type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable</code></td>
    <td>Set the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during an update, as a number (`2`) or percentage (`50%`). Generally, use a percentage so that if you change the number of replicas later you don't have to remember to update the number here, unless you want to limit the rollout to allow only one pod to be down at a time. If you never want to fall below 100% capacity, set this value to `0%` and specify the `spec.strategy.type.rollingUpdate.maxSurge` parameter.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge</code></td>
    <td>Set how many extra resources the deployment can use during the rollout, as a number (`2`) or percentage (`50%`). For example, if your deployment specifies `10` replicas and you set the `maxSurge` to `2`, then during the rollout, two new replicas are created. You now have 12 replicas (10 existing, 2 new). After the two new replicas are ready, the deployment scales down the old replicas to 8 to meet the specified 10 replicas. This process continues until the rollout is complete and all 10 replicas run the new version.<p class="tip">If you want to perform a blue-green instantaneous switch style update, set the `maxSurge` to `100%`. The deployment creates all the new required replicas, then scales down the old version replicas to 0.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

3.  [Roll out ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment) a change. For example, you might want to change the image that you used in your initial deployment.

    1.  Get the deployment name.

        ```
        kubectl get deployments
        ```
        {: pre}

    2.  Get the pod name.

        ```
        kubectl get pods
        ```
        {: pre}

    3.  Get the name of the container that runs in the pod.

        ```
        kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

    4.  Set the new image for the deployment to use.

        ```
        kubectl set image deployment/<deployment_name><container_name>=<image_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

    When you run the commands, the change is immediately applied and logged in the roll-out history.

4.  Check the status of your deployment.

    ```
    kubectl rollout status deployments/<deployment_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you notice something in the status that you want time to follow up on, you can pause and resume your rollout with the following commands.

    ```
    kubectl rollout pause deployment <deployment_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    kubectl rollout resume deployment <deployment_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  Roll back a change.
    1.  View the roll-out history for the deployment and identify the revision number of your last deployment.

        ```
        kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

        **Tip:** To see the details for a specific revision, include the revision number.

        ```
        kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment_name> --revision=<number>
        ```
        {: pre}

    2.  Roll back to the previous version, or specify a revision. To roll back to the previous version, use the following command.

        ```
        kubectl rollout undo deployment/<depoyment_name> --to-revision=<number>
        ```
        {: pre}

## Setting up a continuous delivery pipeline for a cluster
{: #continuous-delivery-pipeline}

Adopt a DevOps approach by using {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipelinelong}}, which includes open toolchains that automate the building and deployment of containerized apps.
{: shortdesc}

Check out this [blog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/connecting-ibm-cloud-kubernetes-service-and-ibm-continuous-delivery) to see how you can use DevOps toolchains to integrate services and streamline your cluster workflow.
{: tip}

1. From the [cluster dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters), select the cluster for which you want to set up a continuous delivery pipeline.
2. Select the **DevOps** tab.
3. Click **Create a toolchain**.
4. Review the available toolchains. IBM provides pre-defined toolchains that you can use to deploy, test, and monitor Kubernetes-native apps or Helm charts. You can expand each toolchain to find an overview of the tools that are set up for you and to find the scripts in GitHub that are used to configure the toolchain in your cluster. For more information about each toolchain, see [Toolchain templates](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_about#templates). If you know what tools you want to use, you can create your own toolchain.
5. Select the toolchain that you want to use and click **Create**.
6. Follow the directions in the console to configure your toolchain. Make sure to include the name of your cluster in your toolchain name so that you can easily find the toolchain that is associated with your cluster later. For more information, see [Creating toolchains](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_getting_started).
7. Select **Delivery Pipeline** to review the stages of your continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline. After you create your toolchain, your pipeline is automatically kicked off and runs through the stages that you configured. Make sure that your stages run successfully and correct any errors.
8. Modify your toolchain. You can add more tools to your toolchain or change the stages of your delivery pipeline.
   1. From the [cluster dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters), select the cluster for which you want to set up a continuous delivery pipeline.
   2. Select the **DevOps** tab.
   3. Select the toolchain that you want to modify.

   Having trouble finding the toolchain that you configured for your cluster? If one of the stages in your continuous delivery pipeline fails, the toolchain does not show in the **DevOps** tab of your cluster. Make sure to review errors in your pipeline by selecting your toolchain from the [{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains) directly.

## Copying deployments to another cluster
{: #copy_apps_cluster}

When you use a [version control system such as Git](/docs/containers?topic=containers-strategy#deploy_organize), configuration management projects such as [`kustomize`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#kustomize), or continuous delivery tools such as [Razee ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://razee.io/) in your cluster, you can deploy your app configuration files quickly from cluster to cluster. Sometimes you have only a few deployments that you tested in a cluster and prefer to copy these deployments and redeploy in another cluster. For example, you might use a free, classic infrastructure Kubernetes cluster for a proof of concept that you did not manage in Git. Now, you are ready to take this proof of concept and deploy it to a standard cluster that runs OpenShift or on VPC infrastructure.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, you need two clusters and the **Manager** [service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for all namespaces in both clusters so that you can copy all the resources from one cluster and deploy them to another.

1.  [Target](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure) the cluster that you want to copy resources from, such as a free cluster.
2.  List all the configuration files in your cluster and verify that you want to copy these configurations.
    ```
    kubectl get all
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    NAME                                   READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/java-web-6955bdbcdf-l756b          1/1     Running            0          59d

    replicaset.apps/java-web-6955bdbcdf    1         1         1       59d
    ```
    {: screen}
3.  Copy the configuration files in your cluster to a local directory. The `--export` flag removes cluster-specific information from the configuration files.
    ```
    kubectl get all -o yaml --export > myconfigs.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}
4.  [Target](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure) the cluster that you want to copy the resources to, such as a production-ready standard cluster.
5.  Optional: If your free cluster used multiple namespaces, create the same namespaces in the standard cluster and [copy the image pull secret to each namespace](/docs/containers?topic=containers-images#copy_imagePullSecret).
6.  Deploy the copied configuration files to your cluster. If a configuration file has specific information that cannot be applied, you might need to update the configuration file and reapply.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f myconfigs.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}
    Example output:
    ```
    pod/java-web-6955bdbcdf-l756b created
    service/java-web created
    deployment.apps/java-web created
    replicaset.apps/java-web-6955bdbcdf created
    ```
    {: screen}
7.  Verify that your configuration files are applied.
    ```
    kubectl get all
    ```
    {: pre}
