# Developing Kubernetes-native apps
{: #app}

Develop a configuration to deploy your app workload to {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}. Because Kubernetes is an extensible container orchestration platform that does not mandate a specific language or app, you can run various workloads such as stateless, stateful, and data-processing apps that are written in the language of your choice.
{: shortdesc}

## Specifying your app requirements in your YAML file
{: #app_yaml}

In Kubernetes, you describe your app in a YAML file that declares the configuration of the Kubernetes object. The Kubernetes API server then processes the YAML file and stores the configuration and required state of the object in the etcd data store. The Kubernetes scheduler schedules your workloads onto the worker nodes within your cluster, taking into account the specification in your YAML file, any cluster policies that the admin sets, and available cluster capacity.
{: shortdesc}

Review a copy of the [complete YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/deploy-apps-clusters/deploy_wasliberty.yaml){: external}. Then, review the following sections to understand how you can enhance your app deployment.

Want more information about how Kubernetes objects work together for your deployment? Check out [Understanding Kubernetes objects for apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy#kube-objects).
{: tip}

### Basic deployment metadata
{: #metadata}

Use the appropriate API version for the [kind of Kubernetes object](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy#object) that you deploy. The API version determines the supported features for the Kubernetes object that are available to you. The name that you give in the metadata is the object's name, not its label. You use the name when interacting with your object, such as `kubectl get deployment <name>`.
{: shortdesc}

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wasliberty
```
{: codeblock}

### Replica set
{: #replicaset}

To increase the availability of your app, you can specify a replica set in your deployment. In a replica set, you define how many instances of your app that you want to deploy. Replica sets are managed and monitored by your Kubernetes deployment. If one app instance goes down, Kubernetes automatically spins up a new instance of your app to maintain the specified number of app instances.
{: shortdesc}

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
```
{: codeblock}

### Labels
{: #label}

With [labels](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy#deploy_organize), you can mark different types of resources in your cluster with the same `key: value` pair. Then, you can specify the selector to match the label so that you can build upon these other resources. If you plan to expose your app publicly, you must use a label that matches the selector that you specify in the service. In the example, the deployment spec uses the template that matches the label `app: wasliberty.`
{: shortdesc}

You can retrieve objects that are labeled in your cluster, such as to see `staging` or `production` components. For example, list all resources with an `env: production` label across all namespaces in the cluster. **Note:** You need access to all namespaces to run this command.

```sh
kubectl get all -l env=production --all-namespaces
```
{: pre}

* For more information about labels, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/){: external}.
* To apply labels to worker nodes, [create your worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#add_pool) with labels or [update an existing worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#worker_pool_labels).
* For a more detailed example, see [Deploying apps to specific worker nodes by using labels](/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_app#node_affinity).

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: wasliberty
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: wasliberty
```
{: codeblock}

### Affinity
{: #affinity}

Specify affinity (co-location) when you want more control over which worker nodes the pods are scheduled on. Affinity affects the pods only at scheduling time. For example, to spread the deployment across worker nodes instead of allowing pods to schedule on the same node, use the `podAntiAffinity` option with your standard clusters. You can define two types of pod anti-affinity: preferred or required.
{: shortdesc}

For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation on Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/){: external}.

Required anti-affinity
:   You can deploy only the number of replicas that you have worker nodes for. For example, if you have three worker nodes in your cluster but you define five replicas in your YAML file, then only three replicas deploy. Each replica lives on a different worker node. The leftover two replicas remain pending. If you add another worker node to your cluster, then one of the leftover replicas deploys to the new worker node automatically. If a worker node fails, the pod does not reschedule because the affinity policy is required. For an example YAML with required, see [Liberty app with required pod anti-affinity](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/deploy-apps-clusters/liberty_requiredAntiAffinity.yaml){: external}.

Preferred anti-affinity
:   You can deploy your pods to nodes with available capacity, which provides more flexibility for your workload. When possible, the pods are scheduled on different worker nodes. For example, if you have three worker nodes with enough capacity in your cluster, it can schedule the five replica pods across the nodes. However, if you add two more worker nodes to your cluster, the affinity rule does not force the two extra pods that are running on the existing nodes to reschedule onto the free node.

Worker node affinity
:   You can configure your deployment to run on only certain worker nodes, such as bare metal. For more information, see [Deploying apps to specific worker nodes by using labels](/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_app#node_affinity).

Example for preferred anti-affinity
```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        podAffinityTerm:
          labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
              - wasliberty
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```
{: codeblock}

### Container image
{: #image}

Specify the image that you want to use for your containers, the location of the image, and the image pull policy. If you don't specify an image tag, by default it pulls the image that is tagged `latest`.
{: shortdesc}

Avoid using the latest tag for production workloads. You might not have tested your workload with the latest image if you are using a public or shared repository, such as Docker Hub or {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}.
{: important}

For example, to list the tags of public IBM images:
1. Switch to the global registry region.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud cr region-set global
    ```
    {: pre}

2. List the IBM images.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud cr images --include-ibm
    ```
    {: pre}

The default `imagePullPolicy` is set to `IfNotPresent`, which pulls the image only if it does not exist locally. If you want the image to be pulled every time that the container starts, specify the `imagePullPolicy: Always`.

```yaml
containers:
- name: wasliberty
  image: icr.io/ibm/liberty:webProfile8
  imagePullPolicy: Always
```
{: codeblock}

### Port for the app's service
{: #port}

Select a container port to open the app's services on. To see which port needs to be opened, refer to your app specs or Dockerfile. The port is accessible from the private network, but not from a public network connection. To expose the app publicly, you must create a NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service. You use this same port number when you [create a `Service` object](#app-service).
{: shortdesc}

Port 25 is blocked for all services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: note}

```yaml
ports:
- containerPort: 9080
```
{: codeblock}

### Resource requests and limits
{: #resourcereq}

Cluster administrators make sure that teams that share a cluster don't take up more than their fair share of compute resources (memory and CPU) by creating a [`ResourceQuota` object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/){: external} for each Kubernetes namespace in the cluster. If the cluster admin sets a compute resource quota, then each container within the deployment template must specify resource requests and limits for memory and CPU, otherwise the pod creation fails.
{: shortdesc}

1. Check whether a resource quota is set for a namespace.
    ```sh
    kubectl get quota --namespace=<namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. See what the quota limits are.
    ```sh
    kubectl describe quota <quota_name> --namespace=<namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}

Even if no resource quota is set, you can include resource requests and limits in your deployment to improve the management of worker node resources.

If a container exceeds its limit, the container might be restarted or fail. If a container exceeds a request, its pod might be evicted if the worker node runs out of that resource that is exceeded. For more information about troubleshooting, see [Pods repeatedly fail to restart or are unexpectedly removed](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ts-app-pod-fail).
{: note}

Request
:   The minimum amount of the resource that the scheduler reserves for the container to use. If the amount is equal to the limit, the request is guaranteed. If the amount is less than the limit, the request is still guaranteed, but the scheduler can use the difference between the request and the limit to fulfill the resources of other containers.

Limit
:   The maximum amount of the resource that the container can consume. If the total amount of resources that is used across the containers exceeds the amount available on the worker node, containers can be evicted to free up space. To prevent eviction, set the resource request equal to the limit of the container. If no limit is specified, the default is the worker node's capacity.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/){: external}.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "1024Mi"
    cpu: "1000m"
```
{: codeblock}

### Liveness and readiness probes
{: #probe}

By default, Kubernetes sends traffic to your app pods after all containers in the pod start, and restarts containers when they crash. However, you can set health checks to improve the robustness of service traffic routing.
{: shortdesc}

For example, your app might have a startup delay. The app processes might begin before the entire app is completely ready, which can affect responses especially when scaling up across many instances. With health checks, you can let your system can know whether your app is running and ready to receive requests. By setting these probes, you can also help prevent downtime when you perform a [rolling update](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update_app#app_rolling) of your app. You can set two types of health checks: liveness and readiness probes.

Liveness probe
:   Set up a liveness probe to check whether the container is running. If the probe fails, the container is restarted. If the container does not specify a liveness probe, the probe succeeds because it assumes that the container is alive when the container is in a **Running** status.

Readiness probe
:   Set up a readiness probe to check whether the container is ready to receive requests and external traffic. If the probe fails, the pod's IP address is removed as a usable IP address for services that match the pod, but the container is not restarted. Setting a readiness probe with an initial delay is especially important if your app takes a while to start. Before the initial delay, the probe does not start, giving your container time to come up. If the container does not provide a readiness probe, the probe succeeds because it assumes that the container is alive when the container is in a **Running** status.

You can set up the probes as commands, HTTP requests, or TCP sockets. The example uses HTTP requests. Give the liveness probe more time than the readiness probe. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/){: external}.

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 9080
  initialDelaySeconds: 300
  periodSeconds: 15
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 9080
  initialDelaySeconds: 45
  periodSeconds: 5
```
{: codeblock}

### Pod Disruption Budget
{: #disruption-budget}

To increase your app's availability, you can control how your app reacts to [disruptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/){: external} based on the type of availability that you want with a `PodDisruptionBudget` object.
{: shortdesc}

A pod disruption budget can help you plan how your app behaves during voluntary disruptions, such as when you initiate a direct restart by updating the app deployment, or involuntary disruptions, such as a kernel panic.
`minAvailable`
:   You can specify the number or percentage of pods that must still be available after a disruption occurs.

`maxUnavailable`
:   You can specify the number or percentage of pods that can be unavailable after a disruption occurs. The example uses `maxUnavailable: 1`.

`selector`
:   Fill in the label to select the set of pods that the `PodDisruptionBudget` applies to. Note that if you used this same label in other pod deployments, the pod applies to those as well.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/){: external}.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: wasliberty
spec:
  maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wasliberty
```
{: codeblock}

### Exposing the app service
{: #app-service}

You can create a service that exposes your app. In the `spec` section, make sure to match the `port` and label values with the ones that you used in the deployment. The service exposes objects that match the label, such as `app: wasliberty` in the following example.
{: shortdesc}

* By default, a service uses [`ClusterIP`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/){: external}, which makes the service accessible only within the cluster but not outside the cluster.
* You can create a NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service to expose the app publicly. These services have two IPs, one external and one internal. When traffic is received on the external IP, it is forwarded to the internal cluster IP. Then, from the internal cluster IP, the traffic is routed to the container IP of the app.
* The example uses `NodePort` to expose the service outside the cluster. For more information about how to set up external access, see [Choosing a NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#external).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wasliberty
  labels:
    app: wasliberty
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 9080
  selector:
    app: wasliberty
    type: NodePort
```
{: codeblock}

If you have a requirement to deploy `hostNetwork` pods to listen on specific ports or to use a `hostPort` to expose your app pods on a specific port on the worker node, use a port in the `11000-11200` range. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} designates the `11000-11200` port range on worker nodes for this purpose to avoid conflicts with local ports and other ports that {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses. Because `hostNetwork` pods and `hostPorts` refer to a particular worker node IP address, the pods are limited to run only on that worker node. If something unanticipated happens, such as the worker node being removed or running out of resources, your pod can't be rescheduled. If you want to expose a pod’s port on the worker node, consider using a [`NodePort` service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-nodeport) instead. For more information, see the [Kubernetes best practices documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#services){: external}.
{: important}

### Configmaps for container environment variables
{: #configmap}

Configmaps provide non-sensitive configuration information for your deployment workloads.
{: shortdesc}

The following example shows how you can reference values from your ConfigMap as environment variables in the container spec section of your deployment YAML. By referencing values from your ConfigMap, you can decouple this configuration information from your deployment to keep your containerized app portable.
* [Help me decide whether to use a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` or `Secret` object for variables](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy#variables).
* For more ways to use configmaps, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/){: external}.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wasliberty
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
      - name: wasliberty
        ...
        env:
          - name: VERSION
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: wasliberty
                key: VERSION
          - name: LANGUAGE
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: wasliberty
                key: LANGUAGE
        ...
---

kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wasliberty
  labels:
    app: wasliberty
data:
  VERSION: "1.0"
  LANGUAGE: en
```
{: codeblock}

### Secrets for container environment variables
{: #secret}

Secrets provide sensitive configuration information such as passwords for your deployment workloads.
{: shortdesc}

The following example shows how you can reference values from your secret as environment variables in the container spec section of your deployment YAML. You can also mount the secret as a volume. By referencing values from your secret, you can decouple this configuration information from your deployment to keep your containerized app portable.
* [Help me decide whether to use a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` or `Secret` object for variables](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_deploy#variables).
* To create a secret, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/){: external}.

For centralized management of all your secrets across clusters and injection at application runtime, try [{{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full_notm}}](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-tutorial-kubernetes-secrets).
{: tip}

```yaml

    username: dXNlcm5hbWU=
    password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
{: codeblock}

### Persistent volumes for container storage
{: #pv}

Persistent volumes (PVs) interface with physical storage to provide persistent data storage for your container workloads.
{: shortdesc}

The following example shows how you can add persistent storage to your app. To provision persistent storage, you create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to describe the type and size of file storage that you want to have. After you create the PVC, the persistent volume and the physical storage are automatically created by using [dynamic provisioning](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#dynamic_provisioning). By referencing the PVC in your deployment YAML, the storage is automatically mounted to your app pod. When the container in your pod writes data to the `/test` mount path directory, data is stored on the NFS file storage instance.
* For more information, see [Understanding Kubernetes storage basics](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#kube_concepts).
* For options on other types of storage that you can provision, see [Planning highly available persistent storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#storage_planning).

## Packaging apps for reuse in multiple environments with Kustomize
{: #kustomize}

As part of a [twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/){: external}, cloud-native app, you want to maintain `dev-to-prod` parity by setting up a continuous development and delivery pipeline that uses a common, version-controlled codebase source. In your codebase repositories, you store your Kubernetes resource configuration manifest files, often in YAML format. You can use the Kubernetes project [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/){: external} both to standardize and customize your deployments across multiple environments.

For example, you can set up a base `kustomization` YAML file to declare Kubernetes objects such as deployments and PVCs that are shared in your development, testing, and production environments. Next, you can set up separate `kustomization` YAML files that have customized configurations for each environment, such as more replicas in production than testing. These customized YAML files can then overlay, or build on, the shared base YAML file so that you can manage environments that are mostly identical except for a few overlay configuration differences that you source-control. For more information about Kustomize such as a glossary and FAQs, check out the [Kustomize docs](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/){: external}.

Before you begin: 
* Make sure that your [`kubectl` version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) matches your cluster version.
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To set up configuration files with Kustomize:
1. [Install the `kustomize` tool](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/){: external}.
    - For macOS, you can use the `brew` package manager.
        ```sh
        brew install kustomize
        ```
        {: pre}

    - For Windows, you can use the `chocolatey` package manager.
        ```sh
        choco install kustomize
        ```
        {: pre}

2. Create a directory for your app in a version control system, such as Git.
    ```sh
    git init ~/<my_app>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Create your repo structure for your `kustomize` [`base`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/glossary/#base){: external} directory, [`overlay`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/glossary/#overlay){: external} directory, and environment directories such as staging and production. In the subsequent steps, you set up these repos for use with `kustomize`.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/base &&
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/overlay &&
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/overlay/staging &&
    mkdir -p ~/<my_app>/overlay/prod
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example repo structure
    ```sh
    .
    ├── base
    └── overlay
        ├── prod
        └── staging
    ```
    {: screen}

4. Set up the `base` repo.
    1. Navigate to the base repo.
        ```sh
        cd ~/<my_app>/base
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Create an initial set of Kubernetes configuration YAML files for your app deployment. You might use the `wasliberty` [YAML example](#yaml-example) to create a deployment, service, config map, and persistent volume claim.
    3. Create a [`kustomization` file](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize#1-make-a-kustomization-file){: external} that specifies the base configuration to be applied across environments. The `kustomization` file must include the list of Kubernetes resource configuration YAMLs that are stored in the same `base` repo. In the `kustomization` file, you can also add configurations that apply to all the resource YAMLs in the base repo, such as a prefix or suffix that is appended to all the resource names, a label, the existing namespace all the resources are created in, secrets, configmaps, and more.
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Kustomization
        namespace: wasliberty
        namePrefix: kustomtest-
        nameSuffix: -v2
        commonLabels:
          app: kustomized-wasliberty
        resources:
        - deployment.yaml
        - service.yaml
        - pvc.yaml
        - configmap.yaml
        - secret.yaml
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        The names of the `resources` YAMLs must match the names of the other files in the `base` repo. You might include multiple configurations in the same file, but in the example, the configurations are separate files such as `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `pvc.yaml`.

    4. Build your resource YAML files with the configurations that you defined in the `kustomization` base YAML file. The resources are built by combining the configurations in the `kustomization` and resource YAMLs together. The combined YAML files are returned in `stdout` in the output. Use this same command to build any subsequent changes that you make to the `kustomization` YAML, such adding a label.
        ```sh
        kustomize build
        ```
        {: pre}

5. Set up your overlay repo with unique `kustomization` YAML files for each of your environments, such as staging and prod.
    1. In the staging repo, create a `kustomization.yaml` file. Add any configurations that are unique to staging, such as a label, image tag, or YAML for a new component that you want to test out.
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Kustomization
        namePrefix: staging-
        commonLabels:
          env: staging
          owner: TeamA
        bases:
        - ../../base
        patchesStrategicMerge:
        - configmap.yaml
        - new_staging_resource.yaml
        resources:
        - new_staging_resource.yaml
        ```
        {: codeblock}
        
        | Component | Description |
        | ----- | ---------- |
        | `namePrefix` | Specify a prefix to attach to the name of each resource that you want to create with your staging `kustomization` file, such as `staging-`. |
        | `commonLabels` | Add labels that are unique to the staging objects, such as the staging environment and responsible team. |
        | `bases` | Add a relative path to a directory or URL to a remote repo that contains a base `kustomization` file. In this example, the relative path points to the base `kustomization` file in the `base` repo that you previously created. This field is required for an overlay `kustomization`. |
        | `patchesStrategicMerge` | List the resource configuration YAML files that you want to merge to the base `kustomization`. You must also add these files to the same repo as the `kustomization` file, such as `overlay/staging`. These resource configuration files can contain small changes that are merged to the base configuration files of the same name as a patch. The resource gets all the components that are in the `base` configuration file, plus any additional components that you specify in the `overlay` configuration file. If the configuration is a new file that is not in the base, you must also add the file name to the `resources` field. |
        | `resources` | List any resource configuration YAML files that are unique to the staging repo and not included in the base repo. Include these files in the `patchesStrategicMerge` field also, and add them to the same repo as the `kustomization` file, such as `overlay/staging`. |
        | Other possible configurations | For more configurations that you might add to your file, see the [Make a `kustomization` file](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize#1-make-a-kustomization-file){: external}. |

    2. Build your staging overlay configuration files.
        ```sh
        kustomize build overlay/staging
        ```
        {: pre}

    3. Repeat these steps to create your prod overlay `kustomization` and other configuration YAML files. For example, you might increase the number of replicas in your `deployment.yaml` so that your prod environment can handle more user requests.
    4. Review your `kustomize` repo structure to make sure that it includes all the YAML configuration files that you need. The structure might look similar to the following example.
        ```sh
        ├── base
        │   ├── configmap.yaml
        │   ├── deployment.yaml
        │   ├── kustomization.yaml
        │   ├── pvc.yaml
        │   ├── secret.yaml
        │   └── service.yaml
        └── overlay
            ├── prod
            │   ├── deployment.yaml
            │   ├── kustomization.yaml
            │   └── new_prod_resource.yaml
            └── staging
                ├── configmap.yaml
                ├── kustomization.yaml
                └── new_staging_resource.yaml
        ```
        {: screen}

6. Apply the Kubernetes resources for the environment that you want to deploy. The following example uses the staging repo.
    1. Navigate to the staging overlay directory. If you did not build your resources in the previous step, create them now.
        ```sh
        cd overlay/staging && kustomize build
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Apply the Kubernetes resources to your cluster. Include the `-k` flag and the directory where the `kustomization` file is located. For example, if you are already in the staging directory, include `../staging` to mark the path to the directory.
        ```sh
        kubectl apply -k ../staging
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        configmap/staging-kustomtest-configmap-v2 created
        secret/staging-kustomtest-secret-v2 created
        service/staging-kustomtest-service-v2 created
        deployment.apps/staging-kustomtest-deployment-v2 created
        job.batch/staging-pi created
        persistentvolumeclaim/staging-kustomtest-pvc-v2 created
        ```
        {: screen}
        
    3. Check to make sure that the staging-unique changes are applied. For example, if you added a `staging-` prefix, the pods and other resources that are created include this prefix in their name.
        ```sh
        kubectl get -k ../staging
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        NAME                                        DATA   AGE
        configmap/staging-kustomtest-configmap-v2   2      90s

        NAME                                  TYPE     DATA   AGE
        secret/staging-kustomtest-secret-v2   Opaque   2      90s

        NAME                                    TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
        service/staging-kustomtest-service-v2   NodePort   172.21.xxx.xxx   <none>        9080:30200/TCP   90s

        NAME                                               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
        deployment.apps/staging-kustomtest-deployment-v2   0/3     3            0           91s

        NAME                   COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
        job.batch/staging-pi   1/1           41s        2m37s

        NAME                                              STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS       AGE
        persistentvolumeclaim/staging-kustomtest-pvc-v2   Pending                                      ibmc-file-bronze   90s
        ```
        {: screen}

    4. Repeat these steps for each environment that you want to build.
7. **Optional**: Clean up your environment by removing all the resources that you applied with Kustomize.
    ```sh
    kubectl delete -k <directory>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    configmap "staging-kustomtest-configmap-v2" deleted
    secret "staging-kustomtest-secret-v2" deleted
    service "staging-kustomtest-service-v2" deleted
    deployment.apps "staging-kustomtest-deployment-v2" deleted
    job.batch "staging-pi" deleted
    persistentvolumeclaim "staging-kustomtest-pvc-v2" deleted
    ```
    {: screen}
