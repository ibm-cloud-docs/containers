# {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} technology
{: #ibm-cloud-kubernetes-service-technology}

Learn more about the technology behind {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Docker containers
{: #docker_containers}

Built on existing Linux container technology (LXC), the open source project that is named Docker defined templates for how to package software into standardized units, called containers, that include all of the elements that an app needs to run. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses `containerd` as the container runtime to deploy containers from Docker container images into your cluster.
{:shortdesc}

Learn about some basic Docker concepts:

<dl>
<dt>Image</dt>
<dd>A container image is the base for every container that you want to run. Container images are built from a Dockerfile, a text file that defines how to build the image and which build artifacts to include in it, such as the app, the app's configuration, and its dependencies. Images are always built from other images, making them quick to configure. Let someone else do the bulk of the work on an image and then tweak it for your use.</dd>
<dt>Registry</dt>
<dd>An image registry is a place to store, retrieve, and share container images. Images that are stored in a registry can either be publicly available (public registry) or accessible by a small group of users (private registry). {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} offers public images, such as ibmliberty, that you can use to create your first containerized app. When it comes to enterprise applications, use a private registry like the one that is provided in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users.
</dd>
<dt>Container</dt>
<dd>Every container is created from an image. A container is a packaged app with all of its dependencies so that the app can be moved between environments and run without changes. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not virtualize a device, its operating system, and the underlying hardware. Only the app code, run time, system tools, libraries, and settings are packaged inside the container. Containers run as isolated processes on Ubuntu compute hosts and share the host operating system and its hardware resources. This approach makes a container more lightweight, portable, and efficient than a virtual machine.</dd>
</dl>



### Key benefits of using containers
{: #container_benefits}

<dl>
<dt>Containers are agile</dt>
<dd>Containers simplify system administration by providing standardized environments for development and production deployments. The lightweight run time enables rapid scale-up and scale-down of deployments. Remove the complexity of managing different operating system platforms and their underlying infrastructures by using containers to help you deploy and run any app on any infrastructure quickly and reliably.</dd>
<dt>Containers are small</dt>
<dd>You can fit many containers in the amount of space that a single virtual machine requires.</dd>
<dt>Containers are portable</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>Reuse pieces of images to build containers. </li>
  <li>Move app code quickly from staging to production environments.</li>
  <li>Automate your processes with continuous delivery tools.</li>
  </ul>

## Kubernetes clusters
{: #kubernetes_basics}

<img src="images/certified-kubernetes-resized.png" style="padding-right: 10px;" align="left" alt="This badge indicates Kubernetes certification for IBM Cloud Container Service."/>The open source project that is named Kubernetes combines running a containerized infrastructure with production work loads, open source contributions, and Docker container management tools. The Kubernetes infrastructure provides an isolated and secure app platform for managing containers that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failovers.
{:shortdesc}

Learn about some basic Kubernetes concepts as shown in the following diagram.

![Deployment setup](images/cs_app_tutorial_mz-components1.png)

<dl>
<dt>Account</dt>
<dd>Your account refers to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.</dd>

<dt>Cluster</dt>
<dd>A Kubernetes cluster consists of one or more compute hosts that are called worker nodes. Worker nodes are managed by a Kubernetes master that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. So when you deploy the resources for a containerized app, the Kubernetes master decides which worker node to deploy those resources on, accounting for the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster. Kubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods.</dd>

<dt>Service</dt>
<dd>A service is a Kubernetes resource that groups a set of pods and provides network connectivity to these pods without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet.
</dd>

<dt>Deployment</dt>
<dd>A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you might specify information about other resources or capabilities that are required to run your app, such as services, persistent storage, or annotations. You document a deployment in a configuration YAML file, and then apply it to the cluster. The Kubernetes master configures the resources and deploys containers into pods on the worker nodes with available capacity.
</br></br>
Define update strategies for your app, including the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time. When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether the update is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.</dd>

<dt>Pod</dt>
<dd>Every containerized app that is deployed into a cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a Kubernetes resource that is called a pod. Pods represent small deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group the containers that must be treated as a single unit. In most cases, each container is deployed in its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address.</dd>

<dt>App</dt>
<dd>An app might refer to a complete app or a component of an app. You might deploy components of an app in separate pods or separate worker nodes.</dd>

## Service architecture
{: #architecture}

In a Kubernetes cluster that runs on {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, your containerized apps are hosted on compute hosts that are called worker nodes. To be more specific, the apps run in pods and the pods are hosted on worker nodes. Worker nodes are managed by the Kubernetes master. The communication setup between the Kubernetes master and the worker nodes depends on how you set up your IBM Cloud infrastructure network: an account with a public service endpoint, or a VRF-enabled account with public and private service endpoints.
{: shortdesc}


### Classic cluster architecture
{: #architecture_classic}

The following image shows the components of your cluster and how they interact in an account when only the [public service endpoint is enabled](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#workeruser-master).

What's the difference between the Kubernetes master and a worker node? Glad you asked.

<dl>
  <dt>Kubernetes master</dt>
    <dd>The Kubernetes master is tasked with managing all compute, network, and storage resources in the cluster. The Kubernetes master ensures that your containerized apps and services are equally deployed to the worker nodes in the cluster. Depending on how you configure your app and services the master determines the worker node that has sufficient resources to fulfill the app's requirements.</br></br>The following table describes the components of the Kubernetes master.
    <table>

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>`openvpn-server`</td>
    <td>The OpenVPN server works with the OpenVPN client to securely connect the master to the worker node. This connection supports `apiserver proxy` calls to your pods and services, and `kubectl exec`, `attach`, and `logs` calls to the kubelet.</td>

  <dt>Worker node</dt>
    <dd>Each worker node is a physical machine (bare metal) or a virtual machine that runs on physical hardware in the cloud environment. When you provision a worker node, you determine the resources that are available to the containers that are hosted on that worker node. Out of the box, your worker nodes are set up with an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-managed Docker Engine, separate compute resources, networking, and a volume service. The built-in security features provide isolation, resource management capabilities, and worker node security compliance.</br></br><p class="note">Modifying default worker node components such as `kubelet` is not supported and might cause unexpected results.</p>The following table describes the components of a worker node.

![Kubernetes cluster in a VPC](images/cs_org_ov_vpc.png)

| Component | Description |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| Master |  Master components, including the API server and etcd, have three replicas and are spread across zones for even higher availability. Masters include the same components as described in the community Kubernetes architecture. |
| Worker node |  With {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, the virtual machines that your cluster manages are instances that are called worker nodes. These worker nodes belong to you, and you manage them through the automation tools that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, such as the API, CLI, or console. Unlike classic clusters, you do not see VPC Gen 1 compute worker nodes in your infrastructure portal or separate infrastructure bill, but instead manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes from {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.<br><br>Worker nodes include the same components as described in the Classic architecture. Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 16.64, 18.64. |
| Cluster networking | Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run `kubectl` commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPN gateway appliance on the private network. |
| App networking | You can create a Kubernetes `LoadBalancer` service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes. For more information, see [Exposing apps with VPC load balancers](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas).<br><br>Calico is used as the cluster networking policy fabric. |
| Storage | You can set up only block persistent storage. Block storage is available as a cluster add-on. For more information, see [Storing data on IBM Block Storage for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage). |

## VPC cluster limitations
{: #vpc_ks_limits}

VPC Generation 1 compute clusters in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is released with the following limitations.
{: shortdesc}

**Compute**:
* You can have up to 100 worker nodes across all VPC clusters per account.
* Only certain flavors are available for worker node virtual machines.
* Bare metal machines are not supported.
* You cannot update or reload worker nodes. Instead, you can delete the worker node and rebalance the worker pool with the `ibmcloud ks worker replace` command.
* Cluster autoscaling is not supported.

**Container platforms**: VPC clusters are available for only community Kubernetes clusters, not OpenShift clusters.

**Load balancing for apps**: See [Exposing apps with VPC load balancers: Limitations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas#lbaas_limitations)

**Location**: VPC clusters are available in the following [multizone metro locations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones): Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, and Tokyo.

**Security groups** You cannot use [VPC security groups](/docs/infrastructure/security-groups?topic=security-groups-about-ibm-security-groups#about-ibm-security-groups) to control traffic for your cluster. VPC security groups are applied to the network interface of a single virtual server to filter traffic at the hypervisor level. However, the worker nodes of your VPC cluster exist in a service account and are not listed in the VPC infrastructure dashboard. You cannot attach a security group to your worker nodes instances.

**Storage**:
* You can set up VPC Block Storage and {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} only.
* VPC Block Storage is available as a cluster add-on. For more information, see [Storing data on VPC Block Storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-block). Make sure to [attach a public gateway to all the VPC subnets](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-cli#step-5-attach-a-public-gateway) that the cluster uses so that you can provision VPC Block Storage.
* {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} is available as a Helm chart. For more information, see [Storing data on {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-object_storage).
* File storage and Portworx software-defined storage (SDS) are not available.

**strongSwan VPN service**: Only [outbound VPN connections from the cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpn#strongswan_3) can be established. Additionally, because VPC clusters do not support UDP load balancers, the following `config.yaml` options are not supported for use in strongSwan Helm charts in VPC clusters:
  * `enableServiceSourceIP`
  * `loadBalancerIP`
  * `zoneLoadBalancer`
  * `connectUsingLoadBalancerIP`

**Versions**: VPC clusters must run Kubernetes version 1.15 or later.

**Virtual Private Cloud**: See [Known limitations](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-known-limitations).

**v2 API**: VPC clusters use the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} v2 API](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_api_install#api_about). The v2 API is currently under development, with only a limited number of API operations currently available. You can run certain v1 API operations against the VPC cluster, such as `GET /v1/clusters` or `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`, but not all the information that a Classic cluster has is returned or you might experience unexpected results. For supported VPC v2 operations, see the [CLI reference topic for VPC commands](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cli_classic_vpc_about).
