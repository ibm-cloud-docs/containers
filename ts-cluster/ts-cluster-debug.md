# Debugging clusters
{: #debug_clusters}

{: support}

Review the options to debug your clusters and find the root causes for failures.

1.  List your cluster and find the `State` of the cluster.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks cluster ls
  ```
  {: pre}

2.  Review the `State` of your cluster. If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, start [debugging the worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-debug_worker_nodes).

    You can view the current cluster state by running the `ibmcloud ks cluster ls` command and locating the **State** field.
