# Deprecated: Dedicated cloud
{: #dedicated}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} is deprecated. You cannot create clusters in an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment. To create clusters in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started).
{: deprecated}

If you have an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account, you can deploy Kubernetes clusters in a dedicated cloud environment (`https://<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.bluemix.net`) and connect with the preselected {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that are also running there.
{:shortdesc}

If you do not have an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account, you can [get started with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started) in a public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## About the Dedicated cloud environment
{: #dedicated_environment}

With an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account, available physical resources are dedicated to your cluster only and are not shared with clusters from other {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} customers. You might choose to set up an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment when you want isolation for your cluster and you require isolation for the other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that you use. If you do not have a Dedicated account, you can [create clusters with dedicated hardware in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public](/docs/containers?topic=containers-clusters#clusters_ui).
{: shortdesc}

With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, you can create clusters from the catalog in the Dedicated console or by using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} CLI. To use the Dedicated console, you log in to both your Dedicated and public accounts simultaneously by using your IBMid. You can use the dual login to access your public clusters by using your Dedicated console. To use the CLI, you log in by using your Dedicated endpoint (`api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.bluemix.net.`). You then target the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API endpoint of the public region that is associated with the Dedicated environment.

The most significant differences between {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public and Dedicated are as follows.

*   In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} owns and manages the IBM Cloud infrastructure account that the worker nodes, VLANs, and subnets are deployed into. In {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public, you own the IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
*   In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, specifications for the VLANs and subnets in the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-managed IBM Cloud infrastructure account are determined when the Dedicated environment is enabled. In {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public, specifications for VLANs and subnets are determined when the cluster is created.

### Service architecture
{: #dedicated_ov_architecture}

Each worker node is set up with separate compute resources, networking, and volume service.
{:shortdesc}

Built-in security features provide isolation, resource management capabilities, and worker node security compliance. The worker node communicates with the master by using secure TLS certificates and OpenVPN connection.

<br />


## Setting up {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} on Dedicated
{: #dedicated_setup}

Each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment has a public, client-owned, corporate account in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For users in the Dedicated environment to create clusters, the administrator must add the users to a public corporate account.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:
  * [Set up an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment](/docs/dedicated?topic=dedicated-dedicated#setupdedicated).
  * If your local system or your corporate network controls public internet endpoints by using proxies or firewalls, you must [open required ports and IP addresses in your firewall](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#firewall).
  * [Download the Cloud Foundry CLI ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).

To allow {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} users to access clusters:

1.  The owner of your public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account must generate an API key.
    1.  Log in to the endpoint for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} instance. Enter the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials for the public account owner and select your account when prompted.

        ```
        ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net
        ```
        {: pre}

        If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know that you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
        {: tip}

    2.  Generate an API key for inviting users to the public account. Note the API key value, which the Dedicated account administrator must use in the next step.

        ```
        ibmcloud iam api-key-create <key_name> -d "Key to invite users to <dedicated_account_name>"
        ```
        {: pre}

    3.  Note the GUID of the public account organization that you want to invite users to, which the Dedicated account administrator must use in the next step.

        ```
        ibmcloud account orgs
        ```
        {: pre}

2.  The owner of your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account can invite single or multiple users to your Public account.
    1.  Log in to the endpoint for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} instance. Enter the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials for the Dedicated account owner and select your account when prompted.

        ```
        ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net
        ```
        {: pre}

        If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know that you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
        {: tip}

    2.  Invite the users to the public account.
        * To invite a single user:

            ```
            ibmcloud cf bluemix-admin invite-users-to-public -userid=<user_email> -apikey=<public_API_key> -public_org_id=<public_org_ID>
            ```
            {: pre}

            Replace <em>&lt;user_IBMid&gt;</em> with the email of the user you want to invite, <em>&lt;public_API_key&gt;</em> with the API key generated in the previous step, and <em>&lt;public_org_ID&gt;</em> with the GUID of the public account organization. 

        * To invite all users currently in a Dedicated account organization:

            ```
            ibmcloud cf bluemix-admin invite-users-to-public -organization=<dedicated_org_ID> -apikey=<public_API_key> -public_org_id=<public_org_ID>
            ```

            Replace <em>&lt;dedicated_org_ID&gt;</em> with the Dedicated account organization ID, <em>&lt;public_API_key&gt;</em> with the API key generated in the previous step, and <em>&lt;public_org_ID&gt;</em> with the public account organization GUID. 

    3.  If an IBMid exists for a user, the user is automatically added to the specified organization in the public account. If an IBMid does not exist for a user, then an invitation is sent to the user's email address. After the user accepts the invitation, an IBMid is created for the user, and the user is added to the specified organization in the public account.

    4.  Verify that the users were added to the account.

        ```
        ibmcloud cf bluemix-admin invite-users-status -apikey=<public_API_key>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Invited users that have an existing IBMid have the `ACTIVE` status. Invited users that did not have an existing IBMid have the `PENDING` status before they accept the invitation and the `ACTIVE` status after they accept the invitation.

3.  If any user needs cluster create privileges, you must grant the Administrator role to that user.

    1.  From the menu bar in the public console, click **Manage > Security > Identity and Access**, and then click **Users**.

    2.  From the row for the user to assign access, select the **Actions** menu, and then click **Assign access**.

    3.  Select **Assign access to resources**.

    4.  From the **Services** list, select **{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}**.

    5.  From the **Region** list, select **All current regions** or a specific region, if you are prompted.

    6. Under **Select roles**, select Administrator.

    7. Click **Assign**.

4.  Users can now log in to the Dedicated account endpoint to start creating clusters.

    1.  Log in to the endpoint for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} instance. Enter your IBMid when prompted.

        ```
        ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net
        ```
        {: pre}

        If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know that you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
        {: tip}

    2.  If you are logging in for the first time, provide your Dedicated user ID and password when prompted. Your Dedicated account is authenticated, and the Dedicated and public accounts are linked together. Every time you log in after this first time, you use only your IBMid to log in. For more information, see [Connecting a dedicated ID to your public IBMid](/docs/iam?topic=iam-connect_dedicated_id#connect_dedicated_id).

        You must log in to both your Dedicated account and your public account to create clusters. If you want to log in to only your Dedicated account, use the `--no-iam` flag when you log in to the Dedicated endpoint.
        {: note}

    3.  To create or access clusters in the dedicated environment, you must set the region that is associated with that environment. **Note**: You cannot create clusters in resource groups other than `default`.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks region set
        ```
        {: pre}

5.  If you want to unlink your accounts, you can disconnect your IBMid from your Dedicated user ID. For more information, see [Disconnect your dedicated ID from the public IBMid](/docs/iam?topic=iam-connect_dedicated_id#disconnect_id).

    ```
    ibmcloud iam dedicated-id-disconnect
    ```
    {: pre}

## Creating clusters
{: #dedicated_administering}

Design your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} cluster setup for maximum availability and capacity.
{:shortdesc}

### Creating clusters with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console
{: #dedicated_creating_ui}

1. Open your Dedicated console: `https://<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.bluemix.net`.

2. Select the **Also log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public** check box and click **Log in**.

3. Follow the prompts to log in with your IBMid. If you are logging in to your Dedicated account for the first time, then follow the prompts to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}.

4. From the catalog, select **Containers** and click **Kubernetes cluster**.

5. Configure your cluster details.

    1. Enter a **Cluster Name**. The name must start with a letter, can contain letters, numbers, and hyphen (-), and must be 35 characters or fewer. Use a name that is unique across regions. The cluster name and the region in which the cluster is deployed form the fully qualified domain name for the Ingress subdomain. To ensure that the Ingress subdomain is unique within a region, the cluster name might be truncated and appended with a random value within the Ingress domain name.

    2. Select the **Zone** in which to deploy your cluster. The available zone was pre-defined when the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment was set up.

    3. Choose the Kubernetes API server version for the cluster master node.

    4. Select a type of hardware isolation. Virtual is billed hourly and bare metal is billed monthly.

        - **Virtual - Dedicated**: Your worker nodes are hosted on infrastructure that is devoted to your account. Your physical resources are completely isolated.

        - **Bare Metal**: Billed monthly, bare metal servers are provisioned manually by IBM Cloud infrastructure after you order, and can take more than one business day to complete. Bare metal is best suited for high-performance applications that need more resources and host control.

        Be sure that you want to provision a bare metal machine. Because it is billed monthly, if you cancel it immediately after an order by mistake, you are still charged the full month.
        {:tip}

    5. Select a **Flavor**. The flavor, or machine type, defines the amount of virtual CPU, memory, and disk space that is set up in each worker node and made available to the containers. Available bare metal and virtual machines types vary by the zone in which you deploy the cluster. For more information, see the documentation for the `ibmcloud ks machine-type` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_machine_types). After you create your cluster, you can add different flavors by adding a worker node to the cluster.

    6. Choose the **Number of worker nodes** that you need. Select `3` to ensure high availability of your cluster.

    7. Select a **Public VLAN** (optional) and **Private VLAN** (required). The available public and private VLANs are pre-defined when the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environment is set up. Both VLANs communicate between worker nodes but the public VLAN also communicates with the IBM-managed Kubernetes master. You can use the same VLAN for multiple clusters.
        If worker nodes are set up with a private VLAN only, you must allow worker nodes and the cluster master to communicate by [enabling the private service endpoint](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_cluster#set-up-private-se) or [configuring a gateway appliance](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#workeruser-master).
        {: note}

    8. By default, **Encrypt local disk** is selected. If you choose to clear the check box, then the host's container runtime data is not encrypted. [Learn more about the encryption](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#encrypted_disk).

6. Click **Create cluster**. You can see the progress of the worker node deployment in the **Worker nodes** tab. When the deployment is done, you can see that your cluster is ready in the **Overview** tab.
    Every worker node is assigned a unique worker node ID and domain name that must not be manually changed after the cluster is created. Changing the ID or domain name prevents the Kubernetes master from managing your cluster.
    {: important}

### Creating clusters with the CLI
{: #dedicated_creating_cli}

1.  Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_install).
2.  Log in to the endpoint for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} instance. Enter your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials and select your account when prompted.

    ```
    ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you have a federated ID, use `ibmcloud login -a api.<my-dedicated-cloud-instance>.<region>.bluemix.net --sso` to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. Enter your user name and use the provided URL in your CLI output to retrieve your one-time passcode. You know that you have a federated ID when the login fails without the `--sso` and succeeds with the `--sso` option.
    {: tip}

3.  Target a regional endpoint. The following regional endpoints are supported:
  * Dallas (US South, us-south): `https://us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
  * Frankfurt (EU Central, eu-de): `https://eu-de.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
  * London (UK South, eu-gb): `https://eu-gb.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
  * Sydney (AP South, au-syd): `https://au-syd.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
  * Tokyo (AP North, jp-tok): `https://jp-tok.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
  * Washington, D.C. (US East, us-east): `https://us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com`
  ```
  ibmcloud ks init --host <endpoint>
  ```
  {: pre}
  You cannot use the global endpoint, `https://containers.cloud.ibm.com`. You must target a regional endpoint to create or work with clusters in that region.
  {: important}

4.  Create a cluster with the `cluster create classic` command. When you create a standard cluster, the hardware of the worker node is billed by hours of usage.

    Example:

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster create classic --zone <zone> --machine-type <flavor> --name <cluster_name> --workers <number>
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  Verify that the creation of the cluster was requested.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster ls
    ```
    {: pre}

    * For virtual machines, it can take a few minutes for the worker node machines to be ordered, and for the cluster to be set up and provisioned in your account. Bare metal physical machines are provisioned by manual interaction with IBM Cloud infrastructure, and can take more than one business day to complete.
    * If you see the following error message, [open a support case](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).
        ```
        {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Infrastructure Exception: Could not place order. There are insufficient resources behind router 'router_name' to fulfill the request for the following guests: 'worker_id'.
        ```

    When the provisioning of your cluster is complete, the status of your cluster changes to **deployed**.

    ```
    Name         ID                                   State      Created          Workers    Zone      Version     Resource Group Name

    ```
    {: screen}

6.  Check the status of the worker nodes.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    When the worker nodes are ready, the state changes to **normal** and the status is **Ready**. When the node status is **Ready**, you can then access the cluster.

    Every worker node is assigned a unique worker node ID and domain name that must not be changed manually after the cluster is created. Changing the ID or domain name prevents the Kubernetes master from managing your cluster.
    {: important}

    ```
    ID                                                 Public IP       Private IP       Machine Type   State    Status   Zone   Version

    ```
    {: screen}

7.  Set the cluster that you created as the context for this session. Complete these configuration steps every time that you work with your cluster.

    1.  Get the command to set the environment variable and download the Kubernetes configuration files.

        ```
        ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        When the download of the configuration files is finished, a command is displayed that you can use to set the path to the local Kubernetes configuration file as an environment variable.

        Example for OS X:

        ```
        export KUBECONFIG=/Users/<user_name>/.bluemix/plugins/kubernetes-service/clusters/<cluster_name>/kube-config-prod-dal10-<cluster_name>.yml
        ```
        {: screen}

    2.  Copy and paste the command in the output to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.
    3.  Verify that the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set properly.

        Example for OS X:

        ```
        echo $KUBECONFIG
        ```
        {: pre}

        Output:

        ```
        /Users/<user_name>/.bluemix/plugins/kubernetes-service/clusters/<cluster_name>/kube-config-prod-dal10-<cluster_name>.yml

        ```
        {: screen}

8.  Access your Kubernetes dashboard with the default port 8001.
    1.  Set the proxy with the default port number.

        ```
        kubectl proxy
        ```
        {: pre}

        ```
        Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001
        ```
        {: screen}

    2.  Open the following URL in a web browser to see the Kubernetes dashboard.

        ```
        http://localhost:8001/ui
        ```

### Adding worker nodes
{: #add_workers_dedicated}

With an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, you can create only [single zone clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#single_zone). By default, a single zone cluster is set up with a worker pool that is named `default`. The worker pool groups worker nodes with the same configuration, such as the machine type, that you defined during cluster creation. You can add more worker nodes to your cluster by [resizing an existing worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#resize_pool) or by [adding a new worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers#add_pool). When you add a worker pool, you must add the available zone to the worker pool so that workers can deploy into the zone. However, you cannot add other zones to your worker pools.
{: shortdesc}

### Using private and public image registries
{: #dedicated_images}

Learn more about [securing your personal information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#pi) when you work with container images.

For new namespaces, see the options in [Using private and public image registries with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-images). For namespaces that were set up for single and scalable groups, [use a token and create a Kubernetes secret](#cs_dedicated_tokens) for authentication.

### Adding subnets to clusters
{: #dedicated_cluster_subnet}

Change the pool of available portable public IP addresses by adding subnets to your cluster. For more information, see [Adding subnets to clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-subnets#subnets). Review the following differences for adding subnets to Dedicated clusters.
{: shortdesc}

#### Adding more user-managed subnets and IP addresses to your Kubernetes clusters
{: #dedicated_byoip_subnets}

Provide more of your own subnets from an on-premises network that you want to use to access {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. You can add private IP addresses from those subnets to Ingress and load balancer services in your Kubernetes cluster. User-managed subnets are configured in 1 of 2 ways, depending on the format of the subnet that you want to use.
{: shortdesc}

Requirements:
- User-managed subnets can be added to private VLANs only.
- The subnet prefix length limit is /24 to /30. For example, `203.0.113.0/24` specifies 253 usable private IP addresses, while `203.0.113.0/30` specifies 1 usable private IP address.
- The first IP address in the subnet must be used as the gateway for the subnet.

Before you begin, follow these steps to configure the routing of network traffic into and out of your enterprise network to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} network that will use the user-managed subnet.

1. To use your own subnet, [open a support case](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support) and provide the list of subnet CIDRs that you want to use. **Note**: The way that the ALB and load balancers are managed for on-premises and internal account connectivity differs depending on the format of the subnet CIDR. See the final step for configuration differences.

2. After {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provisions the user-managed subnets, make the subnet available to your Kubernetes cluster.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster user-subnet add --cluster <cluster_name> --subnet-cidr <subnet_CIDR> --private-vlan <private_VLAN>
    ```
    {: pre}
    Replace <em>&lt;cluster_name&gt;</em> with the name or ID of your cluster, <em>&lt;subnet_CIDR&gt;</em> with one of the subnet CIDRs that you provided in the support case, and <em>&lt;private_VLAN&gt;</em> with an available private VLAN ID. You can find the ID of an available private VLAN by running `ibmcloud ks vlan ls`.

3. Verify that the subnets were added to your cluster. The field **User-managed** for user-provided subnets is _`true`_.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster get --show-resources <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    Subnet VLANs
    VLAN ID   Subnet CIDR         Public       User-managed
    1555503   169.xx.xxx.xxx/24   true         false
    1555505   10.xxx.xx.xxx/24    false        false
    1555505   10.xxx.xx.xxx/24    false        true
    ```
    {: screen}

4. **Important**: In classic clusters, if you have multiple VLANs for your cluster, multiple subnets on the same VLAN, or a multizone classic cluster, you must enable a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/resources?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud) for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account so your worker nodes can communicate with each other on the private network. To enable VRF, [contact your IBM Cloud infrastructure account representative](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud#how-you-can-initiate-the-conversion). To check whether a VRF is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud account show` command. If you cannot or do not want to enable VRF, enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/infrastructure/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning). To perform this action, you need the **Network > Manage Network VLAN Spanning** [infrastructure permission](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#infra_access), or you can request the account owner to enable it. To check whether VLAN spanning is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud ks vlan spanning get --region <region>` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_vlan_spanning_get).

5. To configure on-premises and internal account connectivity, choose between these options:
  - If you used a 10.x.x.x private IP address range for the subnet, use valid IPs from that range to configure on-premises and internal account connectivity with Ingress and a load balancer. For more information, see [Planning networking with NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress services](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#external).
  - If you did not use a 10.x.x.x private IP address range for the subnet, use valid IPs from that range to configure on-premises connectivity with Ingress and a load balancer. For more information, see [Planning networking with NodePort, load balancer, or Ingress services](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#external). However, you must use an IBM Cloud infrastructure portable private subnet to configure internal account connectivity between your cluster and other Cloud Foundry-based services. You can create a portable private subnet with the [`ibmcloud ks cluster subnet add`](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_subnet_add) command. For this scenario, your cluster has both a user-managed subnet for on-premises connectivity and an IBM Cloud infrastructure portable private subnet for internal account connectivity.

### Other cluster configurations
{: #dedicated_other}

Review the following options for other cluster configurations:
  * [Managing cluster access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#access_policies)
  * [Updating the Kubernetes master](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master)
  * [Updating worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node)
  * [Configuring cluster logging](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#logging). Log enablement is not supported from the Dedicated endpoint. You must log in to the public {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} endpoint and target your public org and space to enable log forwarding.
  * [Configuring cluster monitoring](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#view_metrics). An `ibm-monitoring` cluster exists within each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} account. This cluster continuously monitors the health of the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} in the Dedicated environment, checking the stability and connectivity of the environment. Do not remove this cluster from the environment.
  * [Removing clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-remove)

## Deploying apps in clusters
{: #dedicated_apps}

You can use Kubernetes techniques to deploy apps in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} clusters and to ensure that your apps are always up and running.
{:shortdesc}

To deploy apps in clusters, you can follow the instructions for [deploying apps in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#app). Review the following differences for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} clusters.

Learn more about [securing your personal information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#pi) when you work with Kubernetes resources.

### Allowing public access to apps
{: #dedicated_apps_public}

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environments, public primary IP addresses are blocked by a firewall. To make an app publicly available, use a [load balancer service](#dedicated_apps_public_load_balancer) or [Ingress](#dedicated_apps_public_ingress) instead of a NodePort service. If you require access to a load balancer service or Ingress that portable public IP addresses, supply an enterprise firewall whitelist to IBM at service onboarding time.
{: shortdesc}

#### Configuring access to an app by using the load balancer service type
{: #dedicated_apps_public_load_balancer}

If you want to use public IP addresses for the load balancer, ensure that an enterprise firewall whitelist was provided to IBM or [open a support case](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support) to configure the firewall whitelist. Then, follow the steps in [Basic and DSR load balancing with network load balancers (NLB)](/docs/containers?topic=containers-loadbalancer).
{: shortdesc}

#### Configuring public access to an app by using Ingress
{: #dedicated_apps_public_ingress}

If you want to use public IP addresses for the Ingress ALB, ensure that an enterprise firewall whitelist was provided to IBM or [open a support case](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support) to configure the firewall whitelist. Then, follow the steps in [Exposing apps to the public](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress#ingress_expose_public).
{: shortdesc}

### Creating persistent storage
{: #dedicated_apps_volume_claim}

To review options for creating persistent storage, see [Persistent data storage options for high availability](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview). To request a backup for your volumes, a restoration from your volumes, a deletion of volumes, or a periodic snapshot of file storage, you must [open a support case](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).
{: shortdesc}

If you choose to provision [file storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage#file_predefined_storageclass), choose non-retain storage classes. Choosing non-retain storage classes helps prevent orphaned persistent storage instances in IBM Cloud infrastructure that you can remove only by opening a support case.

## Creating an {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} token for an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} image registry
{: #cs_dedicated_tokens}

Create a non-expiring token for an image registry that you used for single and scalable groups with clusters in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

1.  Request a permanent registry token for the current session. This token grants access to the images in the current namespace.
    ```
    ibmcloud cr token-add --description "<description>" --non-expiring -q
    ```
    {: pre}

2.  Verify the Kubernetes secret.

    ```
    kubectl describe secrets
    ```
    {: pre}

    You can use this secret to work with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.

3.  Create the Kubernetes secret to store your token information.

    ```
    kubectl --namespace <kubernetes_namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret_name>  --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=token --docker-password=<token_value> --docker-email=<docker_email>
    ```
    {: pre}

    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

4.  Create a pod that references the image pull secret.

    1.  Open your preferred text editor and create a pod configuration script that is named `mypod.yaml`.
    2.  Define the pod and the image pull secret that you want to use to access the registry. To use a private image from a namespace:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: <pod_name>
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: <container_name>
              image: registry.<dedicated_domain>/<my_namespace>/<my_image>:<tag>
          imagePullSecrets:

        <td>The name of the image pull secret that you created earlier.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.

    4.  Create the deployment in your cluster.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f mypod.yaml -n <namespace>
          ```
          {: pre}
