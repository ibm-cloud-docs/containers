# Classic infrastructure roles
{: #classic-roles}

A user with the **Super User** infrastructure access role [sets the API key for a region and resource group](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access-creds) so that infrastructure actions can be performed. Then, the infrastructure actions that other users in the account can perform is authorized through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform access roles. You don't need to edit the other users' classic infrastructure permissions. Use the following table to customize classic infrastructure permissions only when you can't assign **Super User** to the user who sets the API key. For instructions to assign permissions, see [Customizing infrastructure permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-classic-roles).
{: shortdesc}


Classic infrastructure permissions apply only to classic clusters. For VPC clusters, see [Granting user permissions for VPC resources](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).
{: note}


Need to check that the API key or manually set credentials have the required and suggested infrastructure permissions? Use the `ibmcloud ks infra-permissions get` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#infra_permissions_get).
{: tip}

The following table shows the classic infrastructure permissions that the credentials for a region and resource group can have for creating clusters and other common use cases. The description includes how you can assign the permission in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM Classic infrastructure console or the `ibmcloud sl` command.

Create clusters
:    Classic infrastructure permissions that you must have to create a cluster. When you run `ibmcloud ks infra-permissions get`, these permissions are listed as **Required**. For other service permissions that you must have in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM to create clusters, see [Permissions to create a cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-iam-platform-access-roles).

Other common use cases
:    Classic infrastructure permissions that you must have for other common scenarios. Even if you have permission to create a cluster, some limitations might apply. For example, you might not be able to create or work with a cluster with bare metal worker nodes or a public IP address. After cluster creation, further steps to add networking or storage resources might fail. When you run `ibmcloud ks infra-permissions get`, these permissions are listed as **Suggested**.
