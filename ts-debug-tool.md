While you troubleshoot, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} Diagnostics and Debug Tool to run tests and gather pertinent information from your cluster.
{: shortdesc}


Only one version of the Diagnostics and Debug Tool is available at a time. This version is available for all clusters versions. The tool is updated approximately once a month to address vulnerabilities. These updates are applied automatically. When a new version is pushed to a production region, all installed instances in that region are updated.
{: note}


## Enable and run the Diagnostics and Debug Tool add-on
{: #debug-tool-enable}

1. In the [Kubernetes clusters console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external}, click the name of the cluster where you want to install the debug tool add-on.


1. On the **Diagnostics and Debug Tool** card, click **Install**.

1. In the dialog box, click **Install**. Note that it can take a few minutes for the add-on to be installed. To resolve some common issues that you might encounter during the add-on deployment, see [Reviewing add-on state and statuses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-debug_addons).
