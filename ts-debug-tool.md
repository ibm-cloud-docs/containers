2. Click the **Add-ons** tab.

3. On the Diagnostics and Debug Tool card, click **Install**.

4. In the dialog box, click **Install**. Note that it can take a few minutes for the add-on to be installed. To resolve some common issues that you might encounter during the add-on deployment, see [Reviewing add-on state and statuses](/docs/containers?topic=containers-debug_addons).

5. On the Diagnostics and Debug Tool card, click **Dashboard**.

For more information about the function of each test, click the information icon next to the test's name.

7. Click **Run**.

8. Check the results of each test.
    * If any test fails, click the information icon next to the test's name for information about how to resolve the issue.
    * You can also use the results of tests to gather information, such as complete YAMLs, that can help you debug your cluster in the following sections.
