# Storage class reference
{: #storage-file-vpc-sc-ref}

The available storage classes correspond to the predefined {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} profiles. For storage classes with defined IOPs, make sure the IOPs are sufficient for the file share size you want to provision. For more information about the profiles and IOPs tiers, see [{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} `dp2` profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=ui#dp2-profile).

- All file shares are provisioned with zonal availability except `regional` classes which have regional availability.
- All classes are elastic network interface (ENI) enabled.
- All classes support cross-zone mounting.
