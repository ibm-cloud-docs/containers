# Controlling traffic with ACLs
{: #vpc-acls}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc}

Control inbound and outbound traffic to your cluster by creating and applying access control lists (ACLs) to each subnet that your cluster is attached to. Note that these steps outline the minimum ACL rules that are required for basic cluster functionality. You might need to create additional ACL rules based on your use case.
{: shortdesc}

Looking for a simpler security setup? Leave the default ACL for your VPC as-is, and modify the [default security group](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group) instead.
{: tip}

Level of application
:   Virtual Private Cloud subnet

Default behavior
:   When you create a VPC, a default ACL is created in the format `allow-all-network-acl-<VPC_ID>` for the VPC. The ACL includes an inbound rule and an outbound rule that allow all traffic to and from your subnets. Any subnet that you create in the VPC is attached to this ACL by default. ACL rules are applied in a particular order. When you allow traffic in one direction by creating an inbound or outbound rule, you must also create a rule for responses in the opposite direction because responses are not automatically permitted.

Use case
:   If you want to specify which traffic is permitted to the worker nodes on your VPC subnets, you can create a custom ACL for each subnet in the VPC. For example, you can create the following set of ACL rules to block most inbound and outbound network traffic of a cluster, while allowing communication that is necessary for the cluster to function.

Limitations
:   If you create multiple clusters that use the same subnets in one VPC, you can't use ACLs to control traffic between the clusters because they share the same subnets. You can use [Calico network policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies#isolate_workers) to isolate your clusters on the private network.

When you use the following steps to create custom ACLs, only network traffic that is specified in the ACL rules is permitted to and from your VPC subnets. All other traffic that is not specified in the ACLs is blocked for the subnets, such as cluster integrations with third party services. If you must allow other traffic to or from your worker nodes, be sure to specify those rules where noted in the following steps.
{: important}

For more information, see the [VPC documentation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-acls){: external}.

If you have a VPC cluster that runs at version 1.28 or later, you need to include additional ACL rules. For more information, see [Required rules for VPCs with a cluster version 1.28 or later](#acls-128). 
{: important}

## Creating ACLs from the console
{: #acls_ui}

For each subnet that your cluster is attached to, use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC console to create a custom ACL with rules that limit inbound and outbound network traffic to only communication that is necessary for the cluster to function. 
{: shortdesc}

Looking for a simpler security setup? Leave the default ACL for your VPC as-is, and modify the [default security group](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group) instead.
{: tip}

1. Multizone clusters only: In the [Subnets for VPC dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/infrastructure/network/subnets){: external}, note the **IP Range** of each subnet that your cluster is attached to.
2. In the [Access control lists for VPC dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/infrastructure/network/acl){: external}, click **New access control list**.
3. Give your ACL a name and choose the VPC and resource group that your subnets are in.
4. In the **Rules** section, delete the default inbound rule and outbound rule that allow all inbound and outbound traffic.
5. In the **Inbound rules** section, create the following rules by clicking **Create**.

    ACL rules are applied to traffic in a specific order. If you must create custom rules to allow other traffic to or from your worker nodes on this subnet, be sure to set the custom rules' **Priority** before the final rule that denies all traffic. If you add a rule after the deny rule, your rule is ignored, because the packet matches the deny rule and is blocked and removed before it can reach your rule. Note that these steps outline the minimum ACL rules that are required for basic cluster functionality. You might need to create additional ACL rules based on your use case.

7. In the **Attach subnets** section, choose the name of the subnet for which you created this ACL.

8. Click **Create access control list**.

9. Multizone clusters: Repeat steps 2 - 8 to create an ACL for each subnet that your cluster is attached to.

### Creating ACLs with the CLI
{: #acls_cli}

For each subnet that your cluster is attached to, use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI to create a custom ACL with rules that limit inbound and outbound network traffic to only communication that is necessary for the cluster to function. Note that these steps outline the minimum ACL rules that are required to allow a cluster to deploy and to have basic function; they aren't intended to cover all use cases.
{: shortdesc}

Looking for a simpler security setup? Leave the default ACL for your VPC as-is, and modify the [default security group](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-security-group) instead.
{: tip}

Before you begin

1. Install the `infrastructure-service` plug-in. The prefix for running commands is `ibmcloud is`.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud plugin install infrastructure-service
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Target the region that your VPC is in.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud target -r <region>
    ```
    {: pre}

To create an ACL for each subnet that your cluster is attached to,

1. List your VPC subnets. For each subnet that your cluster is attached to, get the **ID** and **Subnet CIDR**.

    If you can't remember which subnets your cluster is attached to, you can run `ibmcloud ks worker get -c <cluster_name_or_ID> -w <worker_node_ID>` for one worker node in each zone of your cluster, and get the **ID** and **CIDR** of the subnet that the worker is attached to.
    {: tip}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is subnets
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    ID                                          Name          Status      Subnet CIDR        Addresses   ACL                                                  Public Gateway                            VPC       Zone         Resource group

    ```
    {: screen}

2. Create an ACL. After you create the ACL, you can add rules to your ACL and apply the ACL to one subnet. Because the rules that you add to your ACL are specific to one subnet, consider naming the ACL in the format `<cluster>-<subnet>-acl`, such as `mycluster-mysubnet1-acl`, for easy identification. When you create the ACL, two rules are automatically created that allow all inbound and all outbound network traffic. In the output, note the ACL ID and the IDs of the two default rules.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-create <cluster>-<subnet>-acl
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    Creating network ACL mycluster-mysubnet1-acl under account Account as user user@email.com...

    ID        740b07cb-4e69-4ef2-b667-42ed27d8b29e

    ```
    {: screen}

3. Export the ACL ID as an environment variable.
    ```sh
    export ACL_ID=<acl_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Delete the default rules that allow all inbound and outbound traffic. After, your ACL still exists, but does not contain any networking rules.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-delete $acl_id <default_inbound_rule_ID> -f
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-delete $acl_id <default_outbound_rule_ID> -f
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Multizone clusters: Add rules to your ACL to allow worker nodes in one subnet to communicate with the worker nodes in all other subnets within the cluster. The subnet for which you create the ACL rule is defined as `0.0.0.0/0` and you use the CIDRs of the other subnets as your destination CIDR. Make sure to create one inbound and one outbound rule for each of the subnets that you want to connect to.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 <other_zone_subnet_CIDR> --name allow-workers-outbound
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound all <other_zone_subnet_CIDR> 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-workers-inbound
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Create rules to allow inbound traffic from and outbound traffic to the `161.26.0.0/16` and `166.8.0.0/14` {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private subnets. The `161.26.0.0/16` rules allow you to create worker nodes in your cluster. The `166.8.0.0/14` rules allow worker nodes to communicate with other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that support private cloud service endpoints, and in clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.19 or earlier, with the cluster master through the private cloud service endpoint.

    Need to connect your worker nodes to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that support only public cloud service endpoints? [Attach a public gateway to the subnet](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters){: external} so that worker nodes can connect to a public endpoint outside of your cluster. Then, create inbound and outbound rules to allow ingress from and egress to the services' public cloud service endpoints.
    {: tip}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 161.26.0.0/16 --name allow-ibm-private-network-outbound1
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 166.8.0.0/14 --name allow-ibm-private-network-outbound2
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound all 161.26.0.0/16 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-ibm-private-network-inbound1
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound all 166.8.0.0/14 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-ibm-private-network-inbound2
    ```
    {: pre}

7. To allow incoming traffic requests to apps that run on your worker nodes through Ingress ALBs or load balancers, allow traffic to the VPC load balancer on port `443` and to worker nodes on ports `30000 - 32767`.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-lb-outbound --source-port-min 443 --source-port-max 443
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-lb-inbound --destination-port-min 443 --destination-port-max 443
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-ingress-outbound --source-port-min 30000 --source-port-max 32767
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-ingress-inbound --destination-port-min 30000 --destination-port-max 32767  
    ```
    {: pre}

8. Optional: Allow access to and from the Kubernetes control plane IP addresses that are used to health check and report the overall status of your Ingress components. Create one inbound and one outbound rule for each [control plane CIDR for the region where your cluster is located](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/tree/master/control-plane-ips){: external}. Alternatively, you can create a single inbound rule and outbound rule to allow all incoming and outgoing traffic on port 80.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound tcp 0.0.0.0/0 <IP_address> --name allow-hc-outbound --source-port-min 80 --source-port-max 80
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound tcp <IP_address> 0.0.0.0/0 --name allow-hc-inbound --destination-port-min 80 --destination-port-max 80
    ```
    {: pre}

9. Optional: If you must allow other traffic to or from your worker nodes on this subnet, add rules for that traffic.

    When you refer to the VPC subnet that your worker nodes are on, you must use `0.0.0.0/0`. For more tips on how to create your rule, see the [VPC CLI reference documentation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#network-acl-rule-add).
    {: note}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id <allow|deny> <inbound|outbound> <protocol> <source_CIDR> <destination_CIDR> --name <new_rule_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    For example, say that you want your worker nodes to communicate with a subnet in your organization's network, `207.42.8.0/24`. Your worker nodes must be able to both send and receive information from devices or services on this subnet. You can create an outbound rule for traffic to and an inbound rule for traffic from your organization's subnet:
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 207.42.8.0/24 --name corporate-network-outbound
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id allow inbound all 207.42.8.0/24 0.0.0.0/0 --name corporate-network-inbound
    ```
    {: screen}

10. Create rules to deny all other egress from and ingress to worker nodes that is not permitted by the previous rules that you created. Because these rules are created last in the chain of rules, they deny an incoming or outgoing connection only if the connection does not match any other rule that is earlier in the rule chain.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id deny outbound all 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 --name deny-all-outbound
    ibmcloud is network-acl-rule-add $acl_id deny inbound all 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 --name deny-all-inbound
    ```
    {: pre}

11. Apply this ACL to the subnet. When you apply this ACL, the rules that you defined are immediately applied to the worker nodes on the subnet.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud is subnet-update <subnet_ID> --network-acl-id $acl_id
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    ID                  a1b2c3d4-f560-471b-b6ce-20067ac93439

    IPv*                ipv4

    IPv6 CIDR           -
    Address Available   244
    Address Total       256
    ACL                 mycluster-mysubnet1-acl(b664769d-514c-407f-a9f3-d44d72706121)
    Gateway             pgw-18a3ebb0-b539-11e9-9838-f3f4efa02374(f8b95e43-a408-4dc8-a489-ed649fc4cfec)

    VPC                 myvpc(ff537d43-a5a4-4b65-9627-17eddfa5237b)
    ```
    {: screen}

12. Repeat steps 2 - 11 for each subnet that you found in step 1.

ACL rules are applied to traffic in a specific order. If you want to add a rule after you complete these steps, ensure that you add the rule before the `deny-all-inbound` or `deny-all-outbound` rule. If you add a rule after these rules, your rule is ignored, because the packet matches the `deny-all-inbound` and `deny-all-outbound` rules and is blocked and removed before it can reach your rule. Create your rule in the proper order by including the `--before-rule-name deny-all-(inbound|outbound)` option.
{: note}


### Required rules for VPCs with a cluster that runs at version 1.28 or later
{: #acls-128}

In version 1.27 and earlier, VPC clusters pull images from the IBM Cloud Container Registry through a private cloud service endpoint for the Container Registry. For version 1.28 and later, this network path is updated so that images are pulled through a VPE gateway instead of a private service endpoint. This change affects all clusters in a VPC; when you create or update a single cluster in a VPC to version 1.28, all clusters in that VPC, regardless of their version or type, have their network path updated. For more information, see [Networking changes for VPC clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions_128#networking_128).

If you update or create a cluster in your VPC, you must make sure that the following ACL rules, or equivalent rules, are implemented to allow connections to and from the VPE Gateway for Registry. If the rules are not already implemented, [add them](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-acls&interface=ui). Each of these rules must be created for each zone in the VPC and must specify the entire VPC address prefix range for the zone as the source (for outbound rules) or destination (for inbound rules) CIDR. To find the VPC address prefix range for each zone in the VPC, run `ibmcloud is vpc-address-prefixes <vpc_name_or_id>`. The priority for each rule must be higher than any rule that otherwise denies this traffic, such as a rule that denies all traffic.

Add the following rules to your custom ACLs.

| Rule type | Protocol | Source IP or CIDR | Source Port | Destination IP or CIDR | Destination Port  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outbound/Allow | TCP | Entire VPC address prefix range | Any | Entire VPC address prefix range | 443 |
| Outbound/Allow | TCP | Entire VPC address prefix range | Any | Entire VPC address prefix range | 4443 |
| Inbound/Allow | TCP | Entire VPC address prefix range | 443 | Entire VPC address prefix range | Any |
| Inbound/Allow | TCP | Entire VPC address prefix range | 4443 | Entire VPC address prefix range | Any |
