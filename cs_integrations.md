## Adding Cloud Foundry services to clusters
{: #adding_cluster}

Add an existing Cloud Foundry service instance to your cluster to enable your cluster users to access and use the service when they deploy an app to the cluster.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

1. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster.
2. [Request an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service](/docs/apps/reqnsi.html#req_instance).
   **Note:** To create an instance of a service in the Washington DC location, you must use the CLI.
3. Cloud Foundry services are supported to bind with clusters, but other services are not. You can see the different service types after you create the service instance and the services are grouped in the dashboard as **Cloud Foundry Services** and **Services**. To bind the services in the **Services** section with clusters, [first create Cloud Foundry aliases](#adding_resource_cluster).

**Note:**
<ul><ul>
<li>You can only add {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services that support service keys. If the service does not support service keys, see [Enabling external apps to use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services](/docs/apps/reqnsi.html#accser_external).</li>
<li>The cluster and the worker nodes must be deployed fully before you can add a service.</li>
</ul></ul>


To add a service:
2.  List available {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services.

    ```
    bx service list
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example CLI output:

    ```
    name                      service           plan    bound apps   last operation
    <service_instance_name>   <service_name>    spark                create succeeded
    ```
    {: screen}

3.  Note the **name** of the service instance that you want to add to your cluster.
4.  Identify the cluster namespace that you want to use to add your service. Choose between the following options.
    -   List existing namespaces and choose a namespace that you want to use.

        ```
        kubectl get namespaces
        ```
        {: pre}

    -   Create a new namespace in your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl create namespace <namespace_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

5.  Add the service to your cluster.

    ```
    bx cs cluster-service-bind <cluster_name_or_ID> <namespace> <service_instance_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    When the service is successfully added to your cluster, a cluster secret is created that holds the credentials of your service instance. Example CLI output:

    ```
    bx cs cluster-service-bind mycluster mynamespace cleardb
    Binding service instance to namespace...
    OK
    Namespace:	mynamespace
    Secret name:     binding-<service_instance_name>
    ```
    {: screen}

6.  Verify that the secret was created in your cluster namespace.

    ```
    kubectl get secrets --namespace=<namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}


To use the service in a pod that is deployed in the cluster, cluster users can access the service credentials of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service by [mounting the Kubernetes secret as a secret volume to a pod](#adding_app).




<br />


## Creating Cloud Foundry aliases for other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service resources
{: #adding_resource_cluster}

Cloud Foundry services are supported for binding with clusters. To bind an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service that is not a Cloud Foundry service to your cluster, create a Cloud Foundry alias for the service instance.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, [request an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service](/docs/apps/reqnsi.html#req_instance).

To create a Cloud Foundry alias for the service instance:

1. Target the org and a space where the service instance is created.

    ```
    bx target -o <org_name> -s <space_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Note the service instance name.
    ```
    bx resource service-instances
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Create a Cloud Foundry alias for the service instance.
    ```
    bx resource service-alias-create <service_alias_name> --instance-name <service_instance>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Verify that the service alias was created.

    ```
    bx service list
    ```
    {: pre}

5. [Bind the Cloud Foundry alias to the cluster](#adding_cluster).



<br />


## Adding services to apps
{: #adding_app}

Encrypted Kubernetes secrets are used to store {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service details and credentials and allow secure communication between the service and the cluster.
{:shortdesc}

Kubernetes secrets are a secure way to store confidential information, such as user names, passwords, or keys. Rather than exposing confidential information via environment variables or directly in the Dockerfile, you can mount secrets to a pod. Then, those secrets can be accessed by a running container in a pod.

When you mount a secret volume to your pod, a file named binding is stored in the volume mount directory that includes all information and credentials that you need to access the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service.

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster. Make sure that the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service that you want to use in your app was [added to the cluster](cs_integrations.html#adding_cluster) by the cluster admin.

1.  List available secrets in your cluster namespace.

    ```
    kubectl get secrets --namespace=<my_namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    NAME                              TYPE            DATA      AGE
    binding-<service_instance_name>   Opaque          1         3m

    ```
    {: screen}

2.  Look for a secret of type **Opaque** and note the **name** of the secret. If multiple secrets exist, contact your cluster administrator to identify the correct service secret.

3.  Open your preferred editor.

4.  Create a YAML file to configure a pod that can access the service details through a secret volume. If you bound more than one service, verify that each secret is associated with the correct service.

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment

            secret:
              defaultMode: 420
              secretName: binding-<service_instance_name>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr></tbody></table>

5.  Create the pod and mount the secret volume.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f secret-test.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

6.  Verify that the pod is created.

    ```
    kubectl get pods --namespace=<my_namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example CLI output:

    ```
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    secret-test-1111454598-gfx32   1/1       Running   0          1m
    ```
    {: screen}

7.  Note the **NAME** of your pod.
8.  Get the details about the pod and look for the secret name.

    ```
    kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:

    ```
    ...
    Volumes:
      service-bind-volume:
        Type:       Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)
        SecretName: binding-<service_instance_name>
    ...
    ```
    {: screen}

    

9.  When implementing your app, configure it to find the secret file that is named **binding** in the mount directory, parse the JSON content and determine the URL and service credentials to access your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service.

You can now access the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service details and credentials. To work with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service, make sure your app is configured to find the service secret file in the mount directory, parse the JSON content and determine the service details.

## Setting up Helm in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}
{: #helm}

[Helm ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://helm.sh/) is a Kubernetes package manager. You can create Helm charts or use preexisting Helm charts to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications that run in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters.
{:shortdesc}

Before using Helm charts with {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}, you must install and initialize a Helm instance your cluster. You can then add the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Helm repository to your Helm instance.

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster where you want to use a Helm chart.

1. Install the <a href="https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm" target="_blank">Helm CLI <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.

2. **Important**: To maintain cluster security, create a service account for Tiller in the `kube-system` namespace and a Kubernetes RBAC cluster role binding for the `tiller-deploy` pod.

    1. In your preferred editor, create the following file and save it as `rbac-config.yaml`.
      **Note**:
        * The `cluster-admin` cluster role is created by default in Kubernetes clusters, so you don’t need define it explicitly.
        * If you are using a version 1.7.x cluster, change the `apiVersion` to `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1`.

      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ServiceAccount
      metadata:
        name: tiller
        namespace: kube-system
      ---
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      kind: ClusterRoleBinding
      metadata:
        name: tiller
      roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: ClusterRole
        name: cluster-admin
      subjects:
        - kind: ServiceAccount
          name: tiller
          namespace: kube-system
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    2. Create the service account and cluster role binding.

        ```
        kubectl create -f rbac-config.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Initialize Helm and install `tiller` with the service account that you created.

    ```
    helm init --service-account tiller
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Verify that the `tiller-deploy` pod has a **Status** of `Running` in your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l app=helm
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    tiller-deploy-352283156-nzbcm   1/1       Running   0          2m
    ```
    {: screen}

5. Add the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Helm repository to your Helm instance.

    ```
    helm repo add ibm  https://registry.bluemix.net/helm/ibm
    ```
    {: pre}

6. List the Helm charts that are currently available in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} repository.

    ```
    helm search ibm
    ```
    {: pre}

7. To learn more about a chart, list its settings and default values.

    For example, to view the settings, documentation, and default values for the strongSwan IPSec VPN service Helm chart:

    ```
    helm inspect ibm/strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

## Visualizing Kubernetes cluster resources
{: #weavescope}

Weave Scope provides a visual diagram of your resources within a Kubernetes cluster, including services, pods, containers, and more. Weave Scope provides interactive metrics for CPU and memory and tools to tail and exec into a container.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   Remember not to expose your cluster information on the public internet. Complete these steps to deploy Weave Scope securely and access it from a web browser locally.
-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui). Weave Scope can be CPU intensive, especially the app. Run Weave Scope with larger standard clusters, not free clusters.
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.


To use Weave Scope with a cluster:
2.  Deploy one of the provided RBAC permissions configuration file in the cluster.

    To enable read/write permissions:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/weave-scope/weave-scope-rbac.yaml"
    ```
    {: pre}

    To enable read-only permissions:

    ```
    kubectl apply --namespace weave -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/weave-scope/weave-scope-rbac-readonly.yaml"
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:

    ```
    clusterrole "weave-scope-mgr" created
    clusterrolebinding "weave-scope-mgr-role-binding" created
    ```
    {: screen}

3.  Deploy the Weave Scope service, which is privately accessible by the cluster IP address.

    <pre class="pre">
    <code>kubectl apply --namespace weave -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/scope.yaml?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '&bsol;n')"</code>
    </pre>

    Output:

    ```
    serviceaccount "weave-scope" created
    deployment "weave-scope-app" created
    service "weave-scope-app" created
    daemonset "weave-scope-agent" created
    ```
    {: screen}

4.  Run a port forwarding command to bring up the service on your computer. Now that Weave Scope is configured with the cluster, to access Weave Scope next time, you can run this port forwarding command without completing the previous configuration steps again.

    ```
    kubectl port-forward -n weave "$(kubectl get -n weave pod --selector=weave-scope-component=app -o jsonpath='{.items..metadata.name}')" 4040
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:

    ```
    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:4040 -> 4040
    Forwarding from [::1]:4040 -> 4040
    Handling connection for 4040
    ```
    {: screen}

5.  Open your web browser to `http://localhost:4040`. Without the default components deployed, you see the following diagram. You can choose to view topology diagrams or tables of the Kubernetes resources in the cluster.
