# Cluster autoscaler
{: #troubleshoot_cluster_autoscaler}

As you use the [cluster autoscaler](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca) for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for troubleshooting.
{: shortdesc}

## Debugging the cluster autoscaler
{: #debug_cluster_autoscaler}

Review the options that you have to debug your cluster autoscaler and find the root causes for failures.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure).

1.  Check that your cluster runs the latest version of the cluster autoscaler Helm chart. 
    1.  Check the chart version. The **CHART** name has the version in the format `ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler-1.1.2`.
        ```
        helm ls
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        NAME                      	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART                           	APP VERSION	NAMESPACE  
        ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler	1       	Wed Aug 28 16:38:23 2019	DEPLOYED	ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler-1.0.8	           	kube-system
        ```
        {: screen}
    2.  Compare the version that runs in your cluster against the [latest **CHART VERSION** of the `ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler` Helm chart](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/helm/iks-charts/ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler) in the **Helm Catalog** console.
    3.  If your version is outdated, [deploy the latest cluster autoscaler to your cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ca#ca_helm).
2.  Check that the cluster autoscaler is configured correctly.
    1.  Get the YAML configuration file of the cluster autoscaler configmap.
        ```
        kubectl get cm iks-ca-configmap -n kube-system -o yaml > iks-ca-configmap.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  In the `data.workerPoolsConfig.json` field, check that the correct worker pools are enabled with the minimum and maximum size per worker pool. 
        *  **`"name": "<worker_pool_name>"`**: The name of your worker pool in the configmap must be exactly the same as the name of the worker pool in your cluster. Multiple worker pools must be comma-separated. To check the name of your cluster worker pools, run `ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls -c <cluster_name_or_ID>`.
        *  **`"minSize": 2`**: In general, the `minSize` must be `2` or greater. Remember that the `minSize` value cannot be `0`, and you can only have a `minSize` of 1 if you [disable the public ALBs](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_alb_configure).
        * **`"maxSize": 3`**: The `maxSize` must be equal to or greater than the `minSize`.
        * **`"enabled": true`**: Set the value to `true` to enable autoscaling the worker pool.
        ```
        data:
            workerPoolsConfig.json: |
                [{"name": "default", "minSize": 2, "maxSize": 3, "enabled": true }]
        ```
        {: screen}
    3.  In the `metadata.annotations.workerPoolsConfigStatus` field, check for a **FAILED CODE** error message. Follow any recovery steps that are included in the error message. For example, you might get a message similar to the following, where you must have the correct permissions to the resource group that the cluster is in.
        ```
        annotations:
            workerPoolsConfigStatus: '{"1:3:default":"FAILED CODE: 400
            ...
            \"description\":\"Unable
            to validate the request with resource group manager.\",\"type\":\"Authentication\",\"recoveryCLI\":\"To
            list available resource groups, run ''ibmcloud resource groups''. Make sure
            that your cluster and the other IBM Cloud resources that you are trying to use
            are in the same resource group. Verify that you have permissions to work with
            the resource group. If you think that the resource group is set up correctly
            and you still cannot use it, contact IBM Cloud support.\"}"}'
        ```
        {: screen}
3.  Review the status of the cluster autoscaler.
    ```
    kubectl describe cm -n kube-system cluster-autoscaler-status
    ```
    {: pre}

    * **`status`**: Review the status message for more troubleshooting information, if any.
    * **`Health`**: Review the overall health of the cluster autoscaler for any errors or failures.
    * **`ScaleUp`**: Review the status of scaleup activity. In general, if the number of worker nodes that are ready and registered match, the scaleup has `NoActivity` because your worker pool has enough worker nodes.
    * **`ScaleDown`**: Review the status of scaledown activity. If the cluster autoscaler identifies `NoCandidates`, your worker pool is not scaled down because none of the worker nodes can be removed without taking away requested resources from your workloads.
    * **`Events`**: Review the events for more troubleshooting information, if any.

    Example of a healthy cluster autoscaler status.
    ```

    {: screen}
4.  Check the health of the cluster autoscaler pod.
    1.  Get the cluster autoscaler pod. If the status is not **Running**, describe the pod.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler
        ```
        {: pre}
    2.  Describe the cluster autoscaler pod. Review the **Events** section for more troubleshooting information.
        ```
        kubectl describe pod -n kube-system <pod_name>
        ```
        {: pre}
    3.  Review the **Command** section to check that the [custom cluster autoscaler configuration](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca#ca_chart_values) matches what you expect, such as the `scale-down-delay-after-add` value.
        ```
        Command:
            ./cluster-autoscaler
            --v=4
            --balance-similar-node-groups=true
            --alsologtostderr=true
            --stderrthreshold=info
            --cloud-provider=IKS
            --skip-nodes-with-local-storage=true
            --skip-nodes-with-system-pods=true
            --scale-down-unneeded-time=10m
            --scale-down-delay-after-add=10m
            --scale-down-delay-after-delete=10m
            --scale-down-utilization-threshold=0.5
            --scan-interval=1m
            --expander=random
            --leader-elect=false
            --max-node-provision-time=120m
        ```
        {: screen}
5.  Search the logs of the cluster autoscaler pod for relevant messages, such as failure messages like `lastScaleDownFailTime`, the `Final scale-up plan`, or [cluster autoscaler events](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-events-are-emitted-by-ca){: external}.

    If your cluster autoscaler pod is unhealthy and cannot stream logs, check your [{{site.data.keyword.la_full}} instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/logging) for the pod logs. Note that if your cluster administrator did not [enable {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} for your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health), you might not have any logs to review.
    {: tip}

    ```
    kubectl logs -n kube-system <pod_name> > logs.txt
    ```
    {: screen}

6.  If you do not find any failures or error messages and you already enabled logging, restart the cluster autoscaler pod. The deployment re-creates the pod.
    ```
    kubectl delete pod -n kube-system <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}
7.  Monitor the cluster autoscaler activities in your cluster to see if the issue is resolved. If you still experience issues, see [Feedback, questions, and support](#getting_help).

**General ways to resolve issues**<br>
1. Keep your cluster environment up to date.
   * Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).
   * [Update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master) to the latest default version for [{{site.data.keyword.containershort}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
2. Make sure that your command line tools are up to date.
   * In the terminal, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up-to-date so that you can use all available commands and flags.
   * Make sure that [your `kubectl` CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).
