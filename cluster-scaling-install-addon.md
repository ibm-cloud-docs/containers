# Enabling the cluster autoscaler add-on in your cluster
{: #cluster-scaling-install-addon}

You can enable the add-on from the console or the command the line.

## Enabling the cluster autoscaler add-on from the console
{: #autoscaler-enable-console}
{: ui}
    
1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters), select the cluster where you want to enable autoscaling.
1. On the **Overview** page, click **Add-ons**.
1. On the **Add-ons** page, locate the Cluster Autoscaler add-on and click **Install**

## Enabling the cluster autoscaler add-on from the CLI
{: #autoscaler-enable-CLI}
{: cli}
    
1. Enable the `cluster-autoscaler` add-on by running the following command.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon enable cluster-autoscaler --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output
    
    ```sh
    Enabling add-on `cluster-autoscaler` for cluster <cluster_name>...
    The add-on might take several minutes to deploy and become ready for use.
    OK
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the add-on is installed and `Ready`.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon ls --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    NAME                 Version   Health State   Health Status   
    cluster-autoscaler   1.0.1     normal         Addon Ready
    ```
    {: screen}

By default, no worker pools are enabled for autoscaling. To enable autoscaling on your worker pools, [update the cluster autoscaler ConfigMap to enable scaling for your worker pools](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-enable).




## Updating the cluster autoscaler add-on
{: #cluster-scaling-update-addon}

This topic applies only to the cluster autoscaler add-on.
{: important}

If you upgrade your cluster to a version that isn't supported by the cluster autoscaler add-on, your apps might experience downtime and your cluster might not scale.
{: important}

The cluster autoscaler has two types of updates.

Patch updates
:   Patch updates are delivered automatically by IBM and don't contain any feature updates or changes in the supported add-on and cluster versions.

Release updates
:   Release updates contain new features for the cluster autoscaler or changes in the supported add-on or cluster versions. You must manually apply release updates to your cluster autoscaler add-on.


1. Check the version of the cluster autoscaler add-on that is deployed in your cluster. If an update is available, review the [release notes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca_changelog) for the latest add-on version.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon ls --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Disable the cluster autoscaler add-on. You might see a warning that resources or data might be deleted. For the cluster autoscaler update, any autoscaling operations that are in process when you disable fail. When you re-enable the add-on, the autoscaling operation is restarted for you. Existing cluster autoscaler resources like the `iks-ca-configmap` are retained even after you disable the add-on. Your worker nodes are not deleted because of disabling the add-on.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon disable cluster-autoscaler --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    Data and resources that you created for the add-on might be deleted when the add-on is disabled. Continue? [y/N]>
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Enable the add-on to install the latest version.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon enable cluster-autoscaler --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Verify the add-on is successfully updated and `Ready`.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon ls --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}
    
    
## Removing the cluster autoscaler add-on from the console
{: #autoscaler-remove-console}
{: ui}

Before disabling the add-on, [edit the autoscaler ConfigMap](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-enable) to stop scaling your working pools.
{: important}

    
1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters), select the cluster where you want to enable autoscaling.
1. On the **Overview** page, click **Add-ons**.
1. On the **Add-ons** page, locate the Cluster Autoscaler add-on and click **Uninstall**

## Removing the cluster autoscaler add-on from the CLI
{: #autoscaler-remove-cli}
{: cli}

## Cluster autoscaler add-on parameter reference
{: #ca_addon_ref}


| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `expander` | Specify how the cluster autoscaler determines which worker pool to scale if you have multiple worker pools.  \n - `random`: Selects randomly between `most-pods` and `least-waste`.  \n - `most-pods`: Selects the worker pool that is able to schedule the most pods when scaling up. Use this method if you are using `nodeSelector` to make sure that pods land on specific worker nodes.  \n - `least-waste`: Selects the worker pool that has the least unused CPU after scaling up. If two worker pools use the same amount of CPU resources after scaling up, the worker pool with the least unused memory is selected. | `random` |
| `ignoreDaemonSetsUtilization` | When set to `true`, the cluster autoscaler ignores DaemonSet pods when it calculates resource utilization for scale-down. | `false` |
| `imagePullPolicy` |Specify when to pull the Docker image.  \n -  `Always`: Pulls the image every time that the pod is started.  \n - `IfNotPresent`: Pulls the image only if the image isn't already present locally.  \n - `Never`: Assumes that the image exists locally and never pulls the image. | `Always` |
| `livenessProbeFailureThreshold` | Specify the number of times that the `kubelet` retries a liveness probe after the pod starts and the first liveness probe fails. After the failure threshold is reached, the container is restarted and the pod is marked `Unready` for a readiness probe, if applicable. | `3` |
| `livenessProbePeriodSeconds` | Specify the interval in seconds that the `kubelet` performs a liveness probe. | `600` |
| `livenessProbeTimeoutSeconds` | Specify the time in seconds after which the liveness probe times out. | `10` |
| `maxBulkSoftTaintCount` | Set the maximum number of worker nodes that can be tainted or untainted with `PreferNoSchedule` at the same time. To disable this feature, set to `0`. | `0` |
| `maxBulkSoftTaintTime` | Set the maximum amount of time that worker nodes can be tainted or untainted with `PreferNoSchedule` at the same time. | `10m` |
| `maxFailingTime` | Set the maximum time in minutes that the cluster autoscaler pod runs without a completed action before the pod is automatically restarted.| `15m`|
| `maxInactivity` | Set the maximum time in minutes that the cluster autoscaler pod runs without any recorded activity before the pod is automatically restarted. | `10m` |
| `maxNodeProvisionTime` | Set the maximum amount of time in minutes that a worker node can take to begin provisioning before the cluster autoscaler cancels the scale-up request. | `120m` |
| `maxRetryGap` | Set the maximum time in seconds to retry after failing to connect to the service API. Use this parameter and the `retryAttempts` parameter to adjust the retry window for the cluster autoscaler. | `3600` |
| `resourcesLimitsCPU` | Set the maximum amount of worker node CPU that the `ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler` pod can consume. | `600m` |
| `resourcesLimitsMemory` | Set the maximum amount of worker node memory that the `ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler` pod can consume. | `600Mi` |
| `resourcesRequestsCPU` | Set the minimum amount of worker node CPU that the `ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler` pod starts with. | `200m` |
| `resourcesRequestsMemory` | Set the minimum amount of worker node memory that the `ibm-iks-cluster-autoscaler` pod starts with. | `200Mi` |
| `retryAttempts` | Set the maximum number of attempts to retry after failing to connect to the service API. Use this parameter and the `maxRetryGap` parameter to adjust the retry window for the cluster autoscaler. | `64` |
| `scaleDownDelayAfterAdd` | Set the amount of time after scale up that scale down evaluation resumes. The default value for `scaleDownDelayAfterAdd` is 10 minutes. | `10m` |
| `scaleDownDelayAfterDelete` | Set the amount of time after node deletion that scale down evaluation resumes. The default value for `scaleDownDelayAfterDelete` is the same as the `scan-interval` which is `1m`. | `1m` |
| `scaleDownUnneededTime` | Set the amount of time in minutes that a worker node must be unnecessary before it can be scaled down. | `10m` |
| `scaleDownUtilizationThreshold` | Set the worker node utilization threshold. If the worker node utilization is less than the threshold, the worker node is considered to be scaled down. Worker node utilization is calculated as the sum of the CPU and memory resources that are requested by all pods that run on the worker node, divided by the worker node resource capacity. | `0.5` |
| `scanInterval` | Set how often in minutes that the cluster autoscaler scans for workload usage that triggers scaling up or down. | `1m` |
| `skipNodesWithLocalStorage` | When set to `true`, worker nodes that have pods that are saving data to local storage are not scaled down. | `true` |
| `skipNodesWithSystemPods` | When set to `true`, worker nodes that have `kube-system` pods are not scaled down. Do not set the value to `false` because scaling down `kube-system` pods might have unexpected results. | `true` |
| `workerPoolsConfig.json` | The worker pools that you want to autoscale, including their minimum and maximum number of worker nodes per zone. `{"name": "<pool_name>","minSize": 1,"maxSize": 2,"enabled":false}` \n - `<pool_name>`is the name or ID of the worker pool that you want to enable or disable for autoscaling. To list available worker pools, run `ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.  \n - `maxSize: <number_of_workers>` is the maximum number of worker nodes per zone that the cluster autoscaler can scale up to. The value must be equal to or greater than the value that you set for the `minSize: <number_of_workers>` size.  \n - `min=<number_of_workers>`: Specify the minimum number of worker nodes per zone that the cluster autoscaler can scale down to. The value must be `2` or greater so that your ALB pods can be spread for high availability. If you [disabled](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_alb_configure) all public ALBs in each zone of your standard cluster, you can set the value to `1`. Keep in mind that setting a `min` size does not automatically trigger a scale-up. The `min` size is a threshold so that the cluster autoscaler does not scale to fewer than this minimum number of worker nodes per zone. If your cluster does not have this number of worker nodes per zone yet, the cluster autoscaler does not scale up until you have workload resource requests that require more resources.  \n - `enabled=(true|false)`: Set the value to `true` to enable the cluster autoscaler to scale your worker pool. Set the value to `false` to stop the cluster autoscaler from scaling the worker pool. Later, if you want to [remove the cluster autoscaler](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-scaling-install-addon#autoscaler-remove-console), you must first disable each worker pool in the ConfigMap. If you enable a worker pool for autoscaling and then later add a zone to this worker pool, restart the cluster autoscaler pod so that it picks up this change: `kubectl delete pod -n kube-system <cluster_autoscaler_pod>`. | By default, the `default` worker pool is **not** enabled, with a `max` value of `2` and a `min` value of `1`. |
