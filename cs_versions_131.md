### Update before master
{: #before_131}

The following table shows the actions that you must take before you update the Kubernetes master.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Calico API server is a managed resource | {{site.data.keyword.containerfull_notm}} now manages the installation of and updates to the Calico API server component. If your cluster contains the `calico-apiserver` namespace, then you must uninstall the Calico API server before upgrading. Also, if you have any network policies blocking egress out of the kube-system/konnectivity-agent pods, including something based on an example policy like [allow-egress-pods-public](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/blob/master/calico-policies/public-network-isolation/us-south/allow-egress-pods-public.yaml){: external} that applies to all pods, you need to also allow egress from the kube-system/konnectivity-agent pods to port 5443 on the calico-apiserver/calico-apiserver pods. |
| Prevent volume mode conversion | Kubernetes snapshot controller now rejects volume mode changes when creating a persistent volume claim from a volume snapshot unless the `snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/allow-volume-mode-change: "true"` annotation has been added to the `VolumeSnapshotContent` that corresponds to the `VolumeSnapshot`. For more information, see [Converting the volume mode of a Snapshot](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/#convert-volume-mode){: external}. |
| Ubuntu 24 is the default operating system | Ubuntu 24 is now the default operating system for {{site.data.keyword.containerfull_notm}} version 1.31 clusters. For more information and possible migration actions related to Ubuntu 24, see [Migrating to a new Ubuntu version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ubuntu-migrate). |

### Update after master
{: #after_131}

The following table shows the actions that you must take after you update the Kubernetes master.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Unsupported:** `kubectl exec` command execution without dash | The deprecated `kubectl exec [POD] [COMMAND]` command execution has been removed and is replaced by `kubectl exec [POD] -- [COMMAND]`.  If your scripts rely on the previous behavior, update them. |
| **Unsupported:** `kubectl drain` `--delete-local-data` option | The deprecated `--delete-local-data` option for the `kubectl drain` command has been removed and is replaced by the `--delete-emptydir-data` option. If your scripts rely on the previous behavior, update them. |
| **Unsupported:** Numerous `kubectl run` options | The deprecated `--filename`, `--force`, `--grace-period`, `--kustomize`, `--recursive`, `--timeout`, and `--wait` options for the `kubectl run` command have been removed. If your scripts rely on the previous behavior, update them. |
| **Deprecated:** Pod `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io` annotations | Pod `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io` annotations are now deprecated. These annotations are replaced by the `securityContext.appArmorProfile` field for pods and containers. If your pods rely on these deprecated annotations, update them to use the `securityContext.appArmorProfile` field instead. For more information, see [AppArmor support is now stable](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/#apparmor-support-is-now-stable){: external}. |
| **Deprecated:** Persistent volume `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options` annotation | The persistent volume `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options` annotation is now deprecated. This annotation is replaced by the `spec.mountOptions` field. If your pods rely on this deprecated annotation, update them to use the `spec.mountOptions` field instead. For more information, see [Mount Options](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#mount-options){: external}. |
