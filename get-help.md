## General ways to resolve cluster issues
{: #help-general}
{: support}

1. Keep your cluster environment up to date.
    * Check monthly for available security and operating system patches to [update your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#worker_node).
    * [Update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#master) to the latest default version for [{{site.data.keyword.containershort}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
2. Make sure that your command line tools are up to date.
    * In the command line, you are notified when updates to the `ibmcloud` CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up-to-date so that you can use all available commands and options.
    * Make sure that [your `kubectl` CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl) client matches the same Kubernetes version as your cluster server. [Kubernetes does not support](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/){: external} `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).

        ibmcloud ks worker get -w <worker_ID> -c <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

3. For issues with resources within your cluster such as pods or services, log in to the cluster and use the Kubernetes API to get more information about them.
