# Why do I see `SyncLoadBalancerFailed` errors when creating a VPC cluster?
{: #ts-loadbalancer-sync-failed}
{: support}

When setting up load balancing on my VPC cluster, I see an error message similar to the following.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh

This error occurs when your IAM allowlist doesn't allow the necessary communication to control plane IPs.
{: tsCauses}

To resolve this issue, add the control plane IPs for the region where your cluster is located to your IAM allowlist.
{: tsResolve}

For a list of control plane IPs by region, see the `IBM/kube-samples` [repo](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/tree/master/control-plane-ips){: external}
