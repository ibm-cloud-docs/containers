# Migrating Cloud Object Storage (COS) apps and data between IBM Cloud accounts
{: #storage-cos-app-migration}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="containers, cloud-object-storage"}
{: toc-completion-time="2h"}

[Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf} [Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc}

In this tutorial, you'll migrate a COS app and data from an {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster in one account, to a {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} cluster in a separate account.


## Prerequisites
{: #cos-migration-prereqs}

[Account 1]{: tag-purple}

In Account 1, you must have the following.

* An {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster.

* A COS instance and a set of HMAC credentials. For more information, see [Service credentials](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials).

* The [COS plug-in installed in your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_install).


[Account 2]{: tag-teal}

In Account 2, the destination account to migrate to, you must have the following.

* A {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} cluster.

* The [COS plug-in installed in your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_install).

* A COS instance and a set of HMAC credentials. For more information, see [Service credentials](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials).

* An empty bucket in your COS instance.

## Optional: Deploy an app in your cluster
{: #cos-mig-app-deploy}
{: step}

[Account 1]{: tag-purple}

If you don't already have an app that you want to migrate, you can deploy the following example app.

1. Create a PVC that references your object storage configuration.

    ```yaml
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata: 
      name: demo #Enter a name for your PVC.
      namespace: default
      annotations: 
      ibm.io/auto-create-bucket: "true"
      ibm.io/auto-delete-bucket: "false" 
      ibm.io/secret-name: SECRET-NAME #Enter the name of the secret you created earlier.
      ibm.io/secret-namespace: NAMESPACE #Enter the namespace where you want to create the PVC.
    spec: 
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
            requests:
              storage: 10Gi
        storageClassName: ibmc-s3fs-cos #The storage class that you want to use.
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the PVC in your cluster.

    ```txt
    oc apply -f pvc-cos.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you create.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: demo-pod
      namespace: default
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000
        fsGroup: 2000
      volumes:
      - name: demo-vol
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: demo
      containers:
      - name: test
        image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        volumeMounts:
        - name: demo-vol
          mountPath: /mnt/cosvol
    ```
    {: codeblock}
   

1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```txt
    oc apply -f demo-pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```txt
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```txt
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    demo-pod                            1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write to your block storage volume by logging in to your pod.

   ```txt
   oc exec demo-pod -- bash -c "ls /mnt/cosvol"
   ```
   {: pre}

## Get the details of your app
{: #cos-mig-app-details}
{: step}

[Account 1]{: tag-purple}

1. List the pods and PVCs.
    ```txt
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Describe your PVC and review the details and make a note of the bucket name.
    ```txt
    kubectl describe PVC -o yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

## Install `rclone`

## View the contents of your COS buckets
{: #rclone-inspect}
{: step}

[Account 1]{: tag-purple} [Account 2]{: tag-teal}


After configuring `rclone`, review the contents of each bucket and then sync the data between buckets in each account.

1. View the contents of the bucket in the first instance.

    ```txt
    rclone ls cos-instance-1:bucket-1
        45338 test.txt
    ```
    {: screen}

1. View the contents of the bucket in instance 2. In this example the bucket name is `bucket-2`.

    ```txt
    rclone ls cos-instance-2:bucket-2
    ```
    {: pre}


## Syncing contents between buckets
{: #rclone-sync}
{: step}

[Account 1]{: tag-purple} [Account 2]{: tag-teal}


1. To move the data from one bucket to another, you can use the `rclone sync` command. In this example `cos-instance-1:bucket-1` is in one account while `cos-instance-2:bucket-2` is a second instance of COS in a separate account.

    Example

    ```txt
    rclone sync -P cos-instance-1:bucket-1 cos-instance-2:bucket-2
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    Transferred:      754.933k / 754.933 kBytes, 100%, 151.979 kBytes/s, ETA 0s
    Errors:                 0
    Checks:                 0 / 0, -
    Transferred:           18 / 18, 100%
    Elapsed time:        4.9
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify the contents of the bucket in `cos-instance-1` have been synced to the bucket in `cos-instance-2`.

    ```txt
    rclone ls cos-instance-2:bucket-2
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```txt
    45338 test.txt
    ```
    {: screen}


## Redeploy your app in Account 2

    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Create the PVC in your cluster.
    ```txt
    kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}


1. Create a YAML configuration file for a pod that mounts the PVC that you create.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: demo-pod
      namespace: default
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000
        fsGroup: 2000
      volumes:
      - name: demo-vol
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: demo
      containers:
      - name: test
        image: nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        volumeMounts:
        - name: demo-vol
          mountPath: /mnt/cosvol
    ```
    {: codeblock}


1. Create the pod in your cluster.

    ```txt
    oc apply -f demo-pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Verify that the pod is deployed. Note that it might take a few minutes for your app to get into a `Running` state.

    ```txt
    oc get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```txt
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    demo-pod                            1/1     Running   0          2m58s
    ```
    {: screen}

1. Verify that the app can write to your block storage volume by logging in to your pod.

   ```txt
   oc exec demo-pod -- bash -c "ls /mnt/cosvol"
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```txt
   test.txt
   ```
   {: pre}
