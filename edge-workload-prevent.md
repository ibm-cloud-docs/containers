# Preventing app workloads from running on edge worker nodes
{: #edge-workload-prevent}

A benefit of edge worker nodes is that they can be specified to run networking services only.
{: shortdesc}

You can prevent workloads from running on edge worker nodes and consuming worker node resources by using [Kubernetes taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/){: external}.

Complete the following steps to prevent other workloads from running on edge worker nodes.


Before you begin
* Ensure that you have the following IAM roles:
    * Any platform access role for the cluster
    * **Manager** service access role for all namespaces
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_cluster)

1. Create a worker pool with the label `dedicated=edge` or add the label to one of your existing worker pools.
    * To create a Classic worker pool, you can use the `worker-pool create classic` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_create).
        ```sh
        ibmcloud oc worker-pool create classic --name POOL_NAME --cluster CLUSTER --flavor FLAVOR --size-per-zone WORKERS_PER_ZONE --hardware ISOLATION --label dedicated=edge
        ```
        {: pre}

    * To create a VPC worker pool, you can use the `worker-pool create vpc-gen2` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cli_worker_pool_create_vpc_gen2).
        ```sh
        ibmcloud oc worker-pool create vpc-gen2 --name POOL_NAME --cluster CLUSTER --flavor FLAVOR --size-per-zone WORKERS_PER_ZONE --hardware ISOLATION --label dedicated=edge
        ```
        {: pre}

    * To label an existing worker pool, you can use the `worker-pool label set` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_label_set).
        ```sh
        ibmcloud oc worker-pool label set --cluster CLUSTER --worker-pool POOL --label dedicated=edge
        ```
        {: pre}

1. Verify that the worker pool and worker nodes have the `dedicated=edge` label.
    * To check the worker pool, run the `get` command.
        ```sh
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

    * To check individual worker nodes, review the **Labels** field of the output of the following command.
        ```sh
        kubectl describe node <worker_node_private_IP>
        ```
        {: pre}


1. Apply a taint to the worker nodes with the `dedicated=edge` label. The taint prevents pods from running on the worker node and removes pods that don't have the `dedicated=edge` label from the worker node. The pods that are removed are redeployed to other worker nodes with capacity.

    To apply a taint to all existing and future worker nodes in a worker pool:
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks worker-pool taint set -c <cluster_name_or_ID> --worker-pool <worker_pool_name_or_ID> --taint dedicated=edge:NoExecute
    ```
    {: pre}

    To apply a taint to individual worker nodes:
    ```sh
    kubectl taint node -l dedicated=edge dedicated=edge:NoExecute
    ```
    {: pre}

    Now, only pods with the `dedicated=edge` toleration are deployed to your edge worker nodes.

2. Verify that your edge nodes are tainted.
    ```sh
    kubectl describe nodes -l dedicated=edge | egrep "Taints|Hostname"
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    Taints:             dedicated=edge:NoExecute
        Hostname:    10.176.48.83
      Taints:             dedicated=edge:NoExecute
    Hostname:    10.184.58.7
    ```
