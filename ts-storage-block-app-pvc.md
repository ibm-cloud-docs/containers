# Why can't my app access or write to PVCs?

Supported infrastructure providers

:   VPC

When you mount a PVC to your pod, you might experience errors when accessing or writing to the PVC.
{: shortdesc}

1. List the pods in your cluster and review the status of the pod.
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Find the root cause for why your app can't access or write to the PVC.
    ```sh
    kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```sh
    kubectl logs <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Review common errors that can occur when you mount a PVC to a pod.

| Symptom or error message | Description | Steps to resolve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Your pod is stuck in a `ContainerCreating` or `CrashLoopBackOff` state. `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume ... read-only.` | The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure back end experienced network problems. To protect your data and to avoid data corruption, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automatically disconnected the block storage server to prevent write operations on block storage instances. | See [Block storage: Block storage changes to read-only](/docs/containers?topic=containers-readonly_block) |
| `failed to mount the volume as "ext4", it already contains xfs. Mount error: mount failed: exit status 32`. | You want to mount an existing block storage instance that was set up with an `XFS` file system. When you created the PV and the matching PVC, you specified an `ext4` or no file system. The file system that you specify in your PV must be the same file system that is set up in your block storage instance. | See [Block storage: Mounting existing block storage to a pod fails due to the wrong file system](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_filesystem) |
