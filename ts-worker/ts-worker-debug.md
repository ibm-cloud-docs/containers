# Debugging worker nodes
{: #debug_worker_nodes}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

Review the options to debug your worker nodes and find the root causes for failures.

**Infrastructure provider**:
  * <img src="../images/icon-classic.png" alt="Classic infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> Classic

## Step 1: Get the worker node state
{: #worker-debug-get-state}

If your cluster is in a **Critical**, **Delete failed**, or **Warning** state, or is stuck in the **Pending** state for a long time, review the state of your worker nodes.

```
ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
```
{: pre}

## Step 2: Review the worker node state
{: #worker-debug-rev-state}

Review the **State** and **Status** field for every worker node in your CLI output.

You can view the current worker node state by running the `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` command and locating the **State** and **Status** fields.

    <tr>
        <td>`Critical`</td>
        <td>A worker node can go into a Critical state for many reasons: <ul><li>You initiated a reboot for your worker node without cordoning and draining your worker node. Rebooting a worker node can cause data corruption in <code>containerd</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, <code>kube-proxy</code>, and <code>calico</code>. </li>
        <li>The pods that are deployed to your worker node do not use proper resource limits for [memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/){: external} and [CPU](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/){: external}. If you set none or excessive resource limits, pods can consume all available resources, leaving no resources for other pods to run on this worker node. This overcommitment of workload causes the worker node to fail. <ol><li>List the pods that run on your worker node and review the CPU and memory usage, requests and limits. <pre class="codeblock"><code>kubectl describe node &lt;worker_private_IP&gt;</code></pre></li><li>For pods that consume a lot of memory and CPU resources, check if you set proper resource limits for memory and CPU. <pre class="codeblock"><code>kubectl get pods &lt;pod_name&gt; -n &lt;namespace&gt; -o json</code></pre></li><li>Optional: Remove the resource-intensive pods to free up compute resources on your worker node. <pre class="codeblock"><code>kubectl delete pod &lt;pod_name&gt;</code></pre><pre class="codeblock"><code>kubectl delete deployment &lt;deployment_name&gt;</code></pre></li></ol></li>
        <li><code>containerd</code>, <code>kubelet</code>, or <code>calico</code> went into an unrecoverable state after it ran hundreds or thousands of containers over time. </li>
        <li>You set up a Virtual Router Appliance for your worker node that went down and cut off the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master. </li><li> Current networking issues in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or IBM Cloud infrastructure that causes the communication between your worker node and the Kubernetes master to fail.</li>
        <li>Your worker node ran out of capacity. Check the <strong>Status</strong> of the worker node to see whether it shows <strong>Out of disk</strong> or <strong>Out of memory</strong>. If your worker node is out of capacity, consider to either reduce the workload on your worker node or add a worker node to your cluster to help load balance the workload.</li>
        <li>The device was powered off from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console resource list ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources). Open the resource list and find your worker node ID in the **Devices** list. In the action menu, click **Power On**.</li></ul>
        In many cases, [reloading](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) your worker node can solve the problem. When you reload your worker node, the latest [patch version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#version_types) is applied to your worker node. The major and minor version is not changed. Before you reload your worker node, make sure to cordon and drain your worker node to ensure that the existing pods are terminated gracefully and rescheduled onto remaining worker nodes. </br></br> If reloading the worker node does not resolve the issue, go to the next step to continue troubleshooting your worker node.<p class="tip">You can [configure health checks for your worker node and enable Autorecovery](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-monitor#autorecovery). If Autorecovery detects an unhealthy worker node based on the configured checks, Autorecovery triggers a corrective action like rebooting a VPC worker node or reloading the operating system on a classic worker node. For more information about how Autorecovery works, see the [Autorecovery blog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/autorecovery-utilizes-consistent-hashing-high-availability).</p>

## Step 3: Get the details for each worker node
{: #worker-debug-get-details}

Get the details for the worker node. If the details include an error message, review the list of [common error messages for worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-common_worker_nodes_issues) to learn how to resolve the problem.

```
ibmcloud ks worker get --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --worker <worker_node_id>
```
{: pre}

## Step 4: Review the infrastructure provider for the worker node
{: #worker-debug-rev-infra}

Review the infrastructure environment to check for other reasons that might cause the worker node issues.
1.  Check with your networking team to make sure that no recent maintenance, such as firewall orsubnet updates, might impact the worker node connections.
2.  Review [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/status/){: external} for **{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}** and the underlying infrastructure provider, such as **Virtual Servers** for classic, **VPC** related components, or **{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}**.
3.  If you have access to the underlying infrastructure, such as classic **Virtual Servers**, review the details of the corresponding machines for the worker nodes.
