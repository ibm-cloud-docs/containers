Could not access Secrets Manager instance, verify S2S is enabled (ESSSMI).
```
{: screen}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} receives an unauthorized message when attempting to update or apply secrets from the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance registered with the cluster.
{: tsCauses}

1. Follow the steps to ensure you have a valid [service-to-service authorization policy](/docs/containers?topic=containers-secrets-mgr#secrets-mgr_setup_s2s) in place for the Kubernetes Service and {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.
{: tsResolve}
