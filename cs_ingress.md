# Exposing apps with Ingress
{: #ingress}

Expose multiple apps in your Kubernetes cluster by creating Ingress resources that are managed by the IBM-provided application load balancer in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Ingress components and architecture
{: #planning}

Ingress is a Kubernetes service that balances network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to your apps. You can use Ingress to expose multiple app services to the public or to a private network by using a unique public or private route.
{:shortdesc}

### What comes with Ingress?
{: #components}

Ingress consists of three components:
<dl>
<dt>Ingress resource</dt>
<dd>To expose an app by using Ingress, you must create a Kubernetes service for your app and register this service with Ingress by defining an Ingress resource. The Ingress resource is a Kubernetes resource that defines the rules for how to route incoming requests for apps. The Ingress resource also specifies the path to your app services, which are appended to the public route to form a unique app URL such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp1`. <br></br>**Note**: As of 24 May 2018, the Ingress subdomain format changed for new clusters. The region or zone name included in the new subdomain format is generated based on the zone where the cluster was created. If you have pipeline dependencies on consistent app domain names, you can use your own custom domain instead of the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain.<ul><li>All clusters created after 24 May 2018 are assigned a subdomain in the new format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region_or_zone&gt;.containers.appdomain.cloud</code>.</li><li>Single-zone clusters created before 24 May 2018 continue to use the assigned subdomain in the old format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.containers.mybluemix.net</code>.</li><li>If you change a single-zone cluster created before 24 May 2018 to multizone by [adding a zone to the cluster](cs_clusters.html#add_zone) for the first time, the cluster continues to use the assigned subdomain in the old format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.containers.mybluemix.net</code>, and is also assigned a subdomain in the new format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region_or_zone&gt;.containers.appdomain.cloud</code>. Either subdomain can be used.</li></ul></br>**Multizone clusters**: The Ingress resource is global, and only one Ingress resource is required per namespace for a multizone cluster.</dd>
<dt>Application load balancer (ALB)</dt>
<dd>The application load balancer (ALB) is an external load balancer that listens for incoming HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or UDP service requests. The ALB then forwards requests to the appropriate app pod according to the rules defined in the Ingress resource. When you create a standard cluster, {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} automatically creates a highly available ALB for your cluster and assigns a unique public route to it. The public route is linked to a portable public IP address that is provisioned into your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account during cluster creation. A default private ALB is also automatically created, but is not automatically enabled.<br></br>**Multizone clusters**: When you add a zone to your cluster, a portable public subnet is added, and a new public ALB is automatically created and enabled on the subnet in that zone. All default public ALBs in your cluster share one public route, but have a different IP addresses. A default private ALB is also automatically created in each zone, but is not automatically enabled.</dd>
<dt>Multizone load balancer (MZLB)</dt>
<dd><p>**Multizone clusters**: Whenever you create a multizone cluster or [add a zone to a single zone cluster](cs_clusters.html#add_zone), a Cloudflare multizone load balancer (MZLB) is automatically created and deployed so that 1 MZLB exists for each region. The MZLB puts the IP addresses of your ALBs behind the same hostname and enables health checks on these IP addresses to determine whether they are available or not. For example, if you have worker nodes in 3 zones in the US-East region, the hostname `yourcluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud` has 3 ALB IP addresses. The MZLB health checks the public ALB IP in each zone of a region and keeps the DNS lookup results updated based on these health checks. For example, if your ALBs have IP addresses `1.1.1.1`, `2.2.2.2`, and `3.3.3.3`, a normal operation DNS lookup of your Ingress subdomain returns all 3 IPs, 1 of which the client accesses at random. If the ALB with IP address `3.3.3.3` becomes unavailable for any reason, such as due to zone failure, then the health check for that zone fails, the MZLB removes the failed IP from the host name, and the DNS lookup returns only the healthy `1.1.1.1` and `2.2.2.2` ALB IPs. The subdomain has a 30 second time to live (TTL), so after 30 seconds, new client apps can access only one of the available, healthy ALB IPs.</p><p>In rare cases, some DNS resolvers or client apps might continue to use the unhealthy ALB IP after the 30-second TTL. These client apps might experience a longer load time until the client app abandons the `3.3.3.3` IP and tries to connect to `1.1.1.1` or `2.2.2.2`. Depending on the client browser or client app settings, the delay can range from a few seconds to a full TCP timeout.</p>
<p>The MZLB load balances for public ALBs that use the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain only. If you use only private ALBs, you must manually check the health of the ALBs and update DNS lookup results. If you use public ALBs that use a custom domain, you can include the ALBs in MZLB load balancing by creating a CNAME in your DNS entry to forward requests from your custom domain to the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain for your cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you use Calico pre-DNAT network policies to block all incoming traffic to Ingress services, you must also whitelist <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare's IPv4 IPs <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> that are used to check the health of your ALBs. For steps on how to create a Calico pre-DNAT policy to whitelist these IPs, see Lesson 3 of the <a href="cs_tutorials_policies.html#lesson3">Calico network policy tutorial</a>.</dd>

### How does a request get to my app with Ingress in a single zone cluster?
{: #architecture-single}

The following diagram shows how Ingress directs communication from the internet to an app in a single-zone cluster:

<img src="images/cs_ingress_singlezone.png" alt="Expose an app in a single-zone cluster by using Ingress" style="border-style: none"/>

1. A user sends a request to your app by accessing your app's URL. This URL is the public URL for your exposed app appended with the Ingress resource path, such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`.

2. A DNS system service resolves the hostname in the URL to the portable public IP address of the load balancer that exposes the ALB in your cluster.

3. Based on the resolved IP address, the client sends the request to the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.

4. The load balancer service routes the request to the ALB.

5. The ALB checks if a routing rule for the `myapp` path in the cluster exists. If a matching rule is found, the request is forwarded according to the rules that you defined in the Ingress resource to the pod where the app is deployed. The source IP address of the package is changed to the IP address of the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running. If multiple app instances are deployed in the cluster, the ALB load balances the requests between the app pods.

### How does a request get to my app with Ingress in a multizone cluster?
{: #architecture-multi}

The following diagram shows how Ingress directs communication from the internet to an app in a multizone cluster:

<img src="images/cs_ingress_multizone.png" alt="Expose an app in a multizone cluster by using Ingress" style="border-style: none"/>

1. A user sends a request to your app by accessing your app's URL. This URL is the public URL for your exposed app appended with the Ingress resource path, such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`.

2. A DNS system service, which acts as the global load balancer, resolves the hostname in the URL to an available IP address that was reported as healthy by the MZLB. The MZLB continuously checks the portable public IP addresses of the load balancer services that expose public ALBs in each zone in your cluster. The IP addresses are resolved in a round-robin cycle, ensuring that requests are equally load balanced among the healthy ALBs in various zones.

3. The client sends the request to the IP address of the load balancer service that exposes an ALB.

4. The load balancer service routes the request to the ALB.

5. The ALB checks if a routing rule for the `myapp` path in the cluster exists. If a matching rule is found, the request is forwarded according to the rules that you defined in the Ingress resource to the pod where the app is deployed. The source IP address of the package is changed to the IP address of the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running. If multiple app instances are deployed in the cluster, the ALB load balances the requests between app pods across all zones.

## Prerequisites
{: #config_prereqs}

Before you get started with Ingress, review the following prerequisites.
{:shortdesc}

**Prerequisites for all Ingress configurations:**
- Ingress is available for standard clusters only and requires at least two worker nodes per zone to ensure high availability and that periodic updates are applied.
- Setting up Ingress requires an [Administrator access policy](cs_users.html#access_policies). Verify your current [access policy](cs_users.html#infra_access).

**Prerequisites for using Ingress in multizone clusters**:
 - If you restrict network traffic to [edge worker nodes](cs_edge.html), at least 2 edge worker nodes must be enabled in each zone for high availability of Ingress pods. [Create an edge node worker pool](cs_clusters.html#add_pool) that spans all the zones in your cluster and has at least 2 worker nodes per zone.
 - If you have multiple VLANs for a cluster, multiple subnets on the same VLAN, or a multizone cluster, you must enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/infrastructure/vlans/vlan-spanning.html#vlan-spanning) for your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account so your worker nodes can communicate with each other on the private network. To perform this action, you need the **Network > Manage Network VLAN Spanning** [infrastructure permission](cs_users.html#infra_access), or you can request the account owner to enable it. To check if VLAN spanning is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud ks vlan-spanning-get` [command](/docs/containers/cs_cli_reference.html#cs_vlan_spanning_get). If you are using {{site.data.keyword.BluDirectLink}}, you must instead use a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link/subnet-configuration.html#more-about-using-vrf). To enable VRF, contact your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account representative.
 - If a zone fails, you might see intermittent failures in requests to the Ingress ALB in that zone.

<br />


## Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces
{: #multiple_namespaces}

One Ingress resource is required per namespace where you have apps that you want to expose.
{:shortdesc}

### All apps are in one namespace
{: #one-ns}

If the apps in your cluster are all in the same namespace, one Ingress resource is required to define routing rules for the apps that are exposed there. For example, if you have `app1` and `app2` exposed by services in a development namespace, you can create an Ingress resource in the namespace. The resource specifies `domain.net` as the host and registers the paths that each app listens on with `domain.net`.

<img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns.png" width="300" alt="One resource is required per namespace." style="width:300px; border-style: none"/>

### Apps are in multiple namespaces
{: #multi-ns}

If the apps in your cluster are in different namespaces, you must create one resource per namespace to define rules for the apps that are exposed there. To register multiple Ingress resources with the cluster's Ingress ALB, you must use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.domain.net` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can create an Ingress resource in each namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.

For example, consider the following scenario:
* You have two versions of the same app, `app1` and `app3`, for testing purposes.
* You deploy the apps in two different namespaces within the same cluster: `app1` into the development namespace, and `app3` into the staging namespace.

To use the same cluster ALB to manage traffic to these apps, you create the following services and resources:
* A Kubernetes service in the development namespace to expose `app1`.
* An Ingress resource in the development namespace that specifies the host as `dev.domain.net`.
* A Kubernetes service in the staging namespace to expose `app3`.
* An Ingress resource in the staging namespace that specifies the host as `stage.domain.net`.
</br>
<img src="images/cs_ingress_multi_ns.png" width="500" alt="Within a namespace, use subdomains in one or multiple resources" style="width:500px; border-style: none"/>

Now, both URLs resolve to the same domain and are thus both serviced by the same ALB. However, because the resource in the staging namespace is registered with the `stage` subdomain, the Ingress ALB correctly routes requests from the `stage.domain.net/app3` URL to only `app3`.

{: #wildcard_tls}
**Note**:
* The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. The IBM-provided TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the wildcard subdomain.
* If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.

### Multiple domains within a namespace
{: #multi-domains}

Within an individual namespace, you can use one domain to access all the apps in the namespace. If you want to use different domains for the apps within an individual namespace, use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can use one resource to specify multiple subdomain hosts within that resource. Alternatively, you can create multiple Ingress resources in the namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.

<img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns_multi_subs.png" alt="One resource is required per namespace." style="border-style: none"/>

**Note**:
* The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. The IBM-provided Ingress TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the wildcard subdomain.
* If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.

<br />


## Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public
{: #ingress_expose_public}

Expose apps that are inside your cluster to the public by using the public Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* [Log in to your account. Target the appropriate region and, if applicable, resource group. Set the context for your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #public_inside_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   Create a Kubernetes service for each app that you want to expose. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included by the cluster ALB in the Ingress load balancing.
      1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myappservice.yaml`.
      2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: myappservice
          spec:
            selector:
              <selector_key>: <selector_value>
            ports:
             - protocol: TCP
               port: 8080
          ```
          {: codeblock}

          <table>
          <thead>
          <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the ALB service YAML file components</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
          <td><code>selector</code></td>
          <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. To target your pods and include them in the service load balancing, ensure that the <em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em> are the same as the key/value pair in the <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code> section of your deployment yaml.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
           <td><code>port</code></td>
           <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
           </tr>
           </tbody></table>
      3.  Save your changes.
      4.  Create the service in your cluster. If apps are deployed in multiple namespaces in your cluster, ensure that the service deploys into the same namespace as the app that you want to expose.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f myappservice.yaml [-n <namespace>]
          ```
          {: pre}
      5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose.


### Step 2: Select an app domain
{: #public_inside_2}

When you configure the public ALB, you choose the domain that your apps will be accessible through.
{: shortdesc}

You can use the IBM-provided domain, such as `mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`, to access your app from the internet. To use a custom domain instead, you can set up a CNAME record to map your custom domain to the IBM-provided domain or set up an A record with your DNS provider using the ALB's public IP address.

**To use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:**

Get the IBM-provided domain. Replace _&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the app is deployed.
```
ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep Ingress
```
{: pre}

Example output:
```
Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
Ingress Secret:         <tls_secret>
```
{: screen}

**To use a custom domain:**
1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided ALB. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field. Using a CNAME is preferred because IBM provides automatic health checks on the IBM subdomain and removes any failing IPs from the DNS response.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the ALB, run `ibmcloud ks alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.

### Step 3: Select TLS termination
{: #public_inside_3}

After you choose the app domain, you choose whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.

* If you use the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, you can use the IBM-provided TLS certificate. IBM-provided TLS certificates are signed by LetsEncrypt and are fully managed by IBM. The certificates expire every 90 days and are automatically renewed 7 days before they expire. **Note**: For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls).
* If you use a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination. If you have apps in one namespace only, you can import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in that same namespace. If you have apps in multiple namespaces, import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in the `default` namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in every namespace. For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls). **Note**: TLS certificates that contain pre-shared keys (TLS-PSK) are not supported.

**If you use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:**

Get the IBM-provided TLS secret for your cluster. Replace _&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the app is deployed.
```
ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep Ingress
```
{: pre}

Example output:
```
Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
Ingress Secret:         <tls_secret>
```
{: screen}
</br>

**If you use a custom domain:**

If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:

```
ibmcloud ks alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
```
{: pre}

If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
1. Generate a key and certificate in one of the following ways:
  * Generate a certificate authority (CA) cert and key from your certificate provider. If you have your own domain, purchase an official TLS certificate for your domain.
    **Important**: Make sure the [CN ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name/) is different for each certificate.
  * For testing purposes, you can create a self-signed certificate by using OpenSSL. For more information, see this [self-signed SSL certificate tutorial ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).
      1. Create a `tls.key`.
          ```
          openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
          ```
          {: pre}
      2. Use the key to create a `tls.crt`.
          ```
          openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.crt
          ```
          {: pre}
2. Convert the cert and key into base-64. 
   1. Encode the cert and key into base-64 and save the base-64 encoded value in a new file. 
      ```
      openssl base64 -in tls.key -out tls.key.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
      
      ```
      openssl base64 -in tls.crt -out tls.crt.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
   2. View the base-64 encoded value for your cert and key. 
      ```
      cat tls.key.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
      
      ```
      cat tls.crt.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
        
3. Create a secret YAML file using the cert and key.
     ```
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: ssl-my-test
     type: Opaque
     data:
       tls.crt: <client_certificate>
       tls.key: <client_key>
     ```
     {: codeblock}

4. Create the certificate as a Kubernetes secret.
     ```
     kubectl create -f ssl-my-test
     ```
     {: pre}


### Step 4: Create the Ingress resource
{: #public_inside_4}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2. Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain or your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully.

      ```
      kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
      ```
      {: pre}

      1. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 5: Access your app from the internet
{: #public_inside_5}

In a web browser, enter the URL of the app service to access.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```
{: pre}

If you use a wildcard domain to expose apps in different namespaces, access those apps with their respective subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

```
http://<subdomain2>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

## Exposing apps that are outside your cluster to the public
{: #external_endpoint}

Expose apps that are outside your cluster to the public by including them in public Ingress ALB load balancing. Incoming public requests on the IBM-provided or your custom domain are forwarded automatically to the external app.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* Ensure that the external app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing can be accessed by using a public IP address.
* [Log in to your account. Target the appropriate region and, if applicable, resource group. Set the context for your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).

To expose apps that are outside your cluster to the public:

1.  Create a Kubernetes service for your cluster that will forward incoming requests to an external endpoint that you will create.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: myexternalservice
        spec:
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>port</code></td>
        <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
        </tr></tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes service for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}
2.  Configure a Kubernetes endpoint that defines the external location of the app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an endpoint configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalendpoint.yaml`.
    2.  Define your external endpoint. Include all public IP addresses and ports that you can use to access your external app.

        ```
        kind: Endpoints
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: myexternalendpoint
        subsets:
          - addresses:
              - ip: <external_IP1>
              - ip: <external_IP2>
            ports:
              - port: <external_port>
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <table>

        <tr>
        <td><code>ip</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;external_IP&gt;</em> with the public IP addresses to connect to your external app.</td>
         </tr>
         <td><code>port</code></td>
         <td>Replace <em>&lt;external_port&gt;</em> with the port that your external app listens to.</td>
         </tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes endpoint for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalendpoint.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Continue with the steps in [Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public](#public_inside_2), beginning with Step 2.

<br />


## Exposing apps to a private network
{: #ingress_expose_private}

Expose apps to a private network by using the private Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* Review the options for planning private access to apps when worker nodes are connected to [a public and a private VLAN](cs_network_planning.html#private_both_vlans) or to [a private VLAN only](cs_network_planning.html#private_vlan).
    * If your worker nodes are connected to a private VLAN only, you must configure a [DNS service that is available on the private network ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/).

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #private_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   Create a Kubernetes service for each app that you want to expose. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included by the cluster ALB in the Ingress load balancing.
      1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myappservice.yaml`.
      2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: myappservice
          spec:
            selector:
              <selector_key>: <selector_value>
            ports:
             - protocol: TCP
               port: 8080
          ```
          {: codeblock}

          <table>
          <thead>
          <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the ALB service YAML file components</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
          <td><code>selector</code></td>
          <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. To target your pods and include them in the service load balancing, ensure that the <em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em> are the same as the key/value pair in the <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code> section of your deployment yaml.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
           <td><code>port</code></td>
           <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
           </tr>
           </tbody></table>
      3.  Save your changes.
      4.  Create the service in your cluster. If apps are deployed in multiple namespaces in your cluster, ensure that the service deploys into the same namespace as the app that you want to expose.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f myappservice.yaml [-n <namespace>]
          ```
          {: pre}
      5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose.


### Step 2: Enable the default private ALB
{: #private_ingress}

When you create a standard cluster, an IBM-provided private application load balancer (ALB) is created in each zone that you have worker nodes and assigned a portable private IP address and a private route. However, the default private ALB in each zone is not automatically enabled. To use the default private ALB to load balance private network traffic to your apps, you must first enable it with either the IBM-provided portable private IP address or your own portable private IP address.
{:shortdesc}

**Note**: If you used the `--no-subnet` flag when you created the cluster, then you must add a portable private subnet or a user-managed subnet before you can enable the private ALB. For more information, see [Requesting more subnets for your cluster](cs_subnets.html#request).

**To enable a default private ALB by using the pre-assigned, IBM-provided portable private IP address:**

1. Get the ID of the default private ALB that you want to enable. Replace <em>&lt;cluster_name&gt;</em> with the name of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks albs --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for private ALBs is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP          Zone
    private-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1   false     disabled   private   -               dal10
    private-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2   false     disabled   private   -               dal12
    public-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal10
    public-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal12
    ```
    {: screen}
    In multizone clusters, the numbered suffix on the ALB ID indicates the order that the ALB was added.
    * For example, the `-alb1` suffix on the ALB `private-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1` indicates that it was the first default private ALB that was created. It exists in the zone where you created the cluster. In the above example, the cluster was created in `dal10`.
    * The `-alb2` suffix on the ALB `private-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2` indicates that it was the second default private ALB that was created. It exists in the second zone that you added to your cluster. In the above example, the second zone is `dal12`.

2. Enable the private ALB. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private ALB from the output in the previous step.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable
   ```
   {: pre}

3. **Multizone clusters**: For high availability, repeat the above steps for the private ALB in each zone.

<br>
**To enable the private ALB by using your own portable private IP address:**

1. Configure the user-managed subnet of your chosen IP address to route traffic on the private VLAN of your cluster.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks cluster-user-subnet-add <cluster_name> <subnet_CIDR> <private_VLAN_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   <table>
   <thead>
   <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the command components</th>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;</code></td>
   <td>The name or ID of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;subnet_CIDR&gt;</code></td>
   <td>The CIDR of your user-managed subnet.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;private_VLAN_ID&gt;</code></td>
   <td>An available private VLAN ID. You can find the ID of an available private VLAN by running `ibmcloud ks vlans`.</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody></table>

2. List the available ALBs in your cluster to get the ID of private ALB.

    ```
    ibmcloud ks albs --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for the private ALB is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP          Zone
    private-cr6d779503319d419ea3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1   false     disabled   private   -               dal10
    public-cr6d779503319d419ea3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal10
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Enable the private ALB. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private ALB from the output in the previous step and <em>&lt;user_IP&gt;</em> with the IP address from your user-managed subnet that you want to use.

   ```
   ibmcloud ks alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable --user-ip <user_IP>
   ```
   {: pre}

4. **Multizone clusters**: For high availability, repeat the above steps for the private ALB in each zone.

### Step 3: Map your custom domain
{: #private_3}

When you configure the private ALB, use a custom domain that your apps will be accessible through.
{: shortdesc}

1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided ALB. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud ks cluster-get <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field. Using a CNAME is preferred because IBM provides automatic health checks on the IBM subdomain and removes any failing IPs from the DNS response.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable private IP address of the IBM-provided ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the ALB, run `ibmcloud ks alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.

### Step 4: Select TLS termination
{: #private_4}

After you map your custom domain, choose whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.

You can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination. If you have apps in one namespace only, you can import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in that same namespace. If you have apps in multiple namespaces, import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in the `default` namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in every namespace. For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls). **Note**: TLS certificates that contain pre-shared keys (TLS-PSK) are not supported.

If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:

```
ibmcloud ks alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
```
{: pre}

If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
1. Generate a key and certificate in one of the following ways:
  * Generate a certificate authority (CA) cert and key from your certificate provider. If you have your own domain, purchase an official TLS certificate for your domain.
    **Important**: Make sure the [CN ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name/) is different for each certificate.
  * For testing purposes, you can create a self-signed certificate by using OpenSSL. For more information, see this [self-signed SSL certificate tutorial ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html).
      1. Create a `tls.key`.
          ```
          openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
          ```
          {: pre}
      2. Use the key to create a `tls.crt`.
          ```
          openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.crt
          ```
          {: pre}
2. Convert the cert and key into base-64. 
   1. Encode the cert and key into base-64 and save the base-64 encoded value in a new file. 
      ```
      openssl base64 -in tls.key -out tls.key.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
      
      ```
      openssl base64 -in tls.crt -out tls.crt.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
   2. View the base-64 encoded value for your cert and key. 
      ```
      cat tls.key.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
      
      ```
      cat tls.crt.base64
      ```
      {: pre}
        
3. Create a secret YAML file using the cert and key.
     ```
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: ssl-my-test
     type: Opaque
     data:
       tls.crt: <client_certificate>
       tls.key: <client_key>
     ```
     {: codeblock}

4. Create the certificate as a Kubernetes secret.
     ```
     kubectl create -f ssl-my-test
     ```
     {: pre}


### Step 5: Create the Ingress resource
{: #private_5}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully.

      ```
      kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
      ```
      {: pre}

      1. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 6: Access your app from your private network
{: #private_6}

1. Before you can access your app, make sure that you can access a DNS service.
  * Public and private VLAN: To use the default external DNS provider, you must [configure edge nodes with public access](cs_edge.html#edge) and [configure a Virtual Router Appliance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/kubernetes-and-bluemix-container-based-workloads-part4/).
  * Private VLAN only: You must configure a [DNS service that is available on the private network ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/).

2. From within your private network firewall, enter the URL of the app service in a web browser.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```
{: pre}

If you use a wildcard domain to expose apps in different namespaces, access those apps with their respective subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

```
http://<subdomain2>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

## Customizing an Ingress resource with annotations
{: #annotations}

To add capabilities to your Ingress application load balancer (ALB), you can add IBM-specific annotations as metadata in an Ingress resource.
{: shortdesc}

Get started with some of the most commonly used annotations.
* [redirect-to-https](cs_annotations.html#redirect-to-https): Convert insecure HTTP client requests to HTTPS.
* [rewrite-path](cs_annotations.html#rewrite-path): Route incoming network traffic to a different path that your backend app listens on.
* [ssl-services](cs_annotations.html#ssl-services): Use TLS to encrypt traffic to your upstream apps that require HTTPS.
* [client-max-body-size](cs_annotations.html#client-max-body-size): Set the maximum size of the body that the client can send as part of a request.

For the full list of supported annotations, see [Customizing Ingress with annotations](cs_annotations.html).

<br />


## Opening ports in the Ingress ALB
{: #opening_ingress_ports}

By default, only ports 80 and 443 are exposed in the Ingress ALB. To expose other ports, you can edit the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
{:shortdesc}

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add a <code>data</code> section and specify public ports `80`, `443`, and any other ports you want to expose separated by a semi-colon (;).

    **Important**: By default, ports 80 and 443 are open. If you want to keep 80 and 443 open, you must also include them in addition to any other ports you specify in the `public-ports` field. Any port that is not specified is closed. If you enabled a private ALB, you must also specify any ports that you want to keep open in the `private-ports` field.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;<port3>"
      private-ports: "80;443;<port4>"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example that keeps ports `80`, `443`, and `9443` open:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;9443"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

 ```
 kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
 ```
 {: pre}

For more information about configmap resources, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/).

<br />


## Preserving the source IP address
{: #preserve_source_ip}

By default, the source IP address of the client request is not preserved. When a client request to your app is sent to your cluster, the request is routed to a pod for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB. If no app pod exists on the same worker node as the load balancer service pod, the load balancer forwards the request to an app pod on a different worker node. The source IP address of the package is changed to the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running.

To preserve the original source IP address of the client request, you can [enable source IP preservation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/#source-ip-for-services-with-typeloadbalancer). Preserving the client’s IP is useful, for example, when app servers have to apply security and access-control policies.

**Note**: If you [disable an ALB](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_alb_configure), any source IP changes you make to the load balancer service exposing the ALB are lost. When you re-enable the ALB, you must enable source IP again.

To enable source IP preservation, edit the load balancer service that exposes an Ingress ALB:

1. Enable source IP preservation for a single ALB or for all the ALBs in your cluster.
    * To set up source IP preservation for a single ALB:
        1. Get the ID of the ALB for which you want to enable source IP. The ALB services have a format similar to `public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a public ALB or `private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a private ALB.
            ```
            kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb
            ```
            {: pre}

        2. Open the YAML for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.
            ```
            kubectl edit svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
            ```
            {: pre}

        3. Under **spec**, change the value of **externalTrafficPolicy** from `Cluster` to `Local`.

        4. Save and close the configuration file. The output is similar to the following:

            ```
            service "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1" edited
            ```
            {: screen}
    * To set up source IP preservation for all public ALBs in your cluster, run the following command:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1", "public-cr17e61e63c6e94b658596ca92d087eed9-alb2" patched
        ```
        {: screen}

    * To set up source IP preservation for all private ALBs in your cluster, run the following command:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        "private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1", "private-cr17e61e63c6e94b658596ca92d087eed9-alb2" patched
        ```
        {: screen}

2. Verify that the source IP is being preserved in your ALB pods logs.
    1. Get the ID of a pod for the ALB that you modified.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep alb
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Open the logs for that ALB pod. Verify that the IP address for the `client` field is the client request IP address instead of the load balancer service IP address.
        ```
        kubectl logs <ALB_pod_ID> nginx-ingress -n kube-system
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Now, when you look up the headers for the requests sent to your backend app, you can see the client IP address in the `x-forwarded-for` header.

4. If you no longer want to preserve the source IP, you can revert the changes you made to the service.
    * To revert source IP preservation for your public ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}
    * To revert source IP preservation for your private ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

## Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level
{: #ssl_protocols_ciphers}

Enable SSL protocols and ciphers at the global HTTP level by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap.
{:shortdesc}

By default, the TLS 1.2 protocol is used for all Ingress configurations that use the IBM-provided domain. You can override the default to instead use TLS 1.1 or 1.0 protocols by following these steps.

**Note**: When you specify the enabled protocols for all hosts, the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 parameters (1.1.13, 1.0.12) work only when OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is used. The TLSv1.3 parameter (1.13.0) works only when OpenSSL 1.1.1 built with TLSv1.3 support is used.

To edit the configmap to enable SSL protocols and ciphers:

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add the SSL protocols and ciphers. Format ciphers according to the [OpenSSL library cipher list format ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html).

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ssl-protocols: "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
     ssl-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

## Tuning ALB performance
{: #perf_tuning}

To optimize performance of your Ingress ALBs, you can change the default settings according to your needs.
{: shortdesc}

### Enabling log buffering and flush timeout
{: #access-log}

By default, the Ingress ALB logs each request as it arrives. If you have an environment that is heavily used, logging each request as it arrives can greatly increase disk I/O utilization. To avoid continuous disk I/O, you can enable log buffering and flush timeout for the ALB by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` Ingress configmap. When buffering is enabled, instead of performing a separate write operation for each log entry, the ALB buffers a series of entries and writes them to the file together in a single operation.

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Edit the configmap.
    1. Enable log buffering by adding the `access-log-buffering` field and setting it to `"true"`.

    2. Set the threshold for when the ALB should write buffer contents to the log.
        * Time interval: Add the `flush-interval` field and set it to how often the ALB should write to the log. For example, if the default value of `5m` is used, the ALB writes buffer contents to the log once every 5 minutes.
        * Buffer size: Add the `buffer-size` field and set it to how much log memory can be held in the buffer before the ALB writes the buffer contents to the log. For example, if the default value of `100KB` is used, the ALB writes buffer contents to the log every time the buffer reaches 100kb of log content.
        * Time interval or buffer size: When both `flush-interval` and `buffer-size` are set, the ALB writes buffer content to the log based on whichever threshold parameter is met first.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    data:
      access-log-buffering: "true"
      flush-interval: "5m"
      buffer-size: "100KB"
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      ...
    ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that your ALB is configured with the access log changes.

   ```
   kubectl logs -n kube-system <ALB_ID> -c nginx-ingress
   ```
   {: pre}

### Changing the number or duration of keepalive connections
{: #keepalive_time}

Keepalive connections can have a major impact on performance by reducing the CPU and network overhead needed to open and close connections. To optimize the performance of your ALBs, you can change the maximum number of keepalive connections between the ALB and the client and how long the keepalive connections can last.
{: shortdesc}

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change the values of `keep-alive-requests` and `keep-alive`.
    * `keep-alive-requests`: The number of keepalive client connections that can stay open to the Ingress ALB. The default is `4096`.
    * `keep-alive`: The timeout, in seconds, during which the keepalive client connection stays open to the Ingress ALB. The default is `8s`.
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     keep-alive-requests: "4096"
     keep-alive: "8s"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}


### Changing the pending connections backlog
{: #backlog}

You can decrease the default backlog setting for how many pending connections can wait in the server queue.
{: shortdesc}

In the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` Ingress configmap, the `backlog` field sets the maximum number of pending connections that can wait in the server queue. By default, `backlog` is set to `32768`. You can override the default by editing the Ingress configmap.

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change the value of `backlog` from `32768` to a lower value. The value must be equal to or lesser than 32768.

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     backlog: "32768"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}


### Tuning kernel performance
{: #kernel}

To optimize performance of your Ingress ALBs, you can also [change the Linux kernel `sysctl` parameters on worker nodes](cs_performance.html). Worker nodes are automatically provisioned with optimized kernel tuning, so only change these settings if you have specific performance optimization requirements.

<br />


## Bringing your own Ingress controller
{: #user_managed}

Bring your own Ingress controller and run it on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} while leveraging the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain and TLS certificate assigned to your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

Configuring your own custom Ingress controller can be useful when you have specific Ingress requirements. When you bring your own Ingress controller instead of using the IBM-provided Ingress ALB, you are responsible for supplying the controller image, maintaining the controller, and updating the controller.

1. Get the ID of the default public ALB. The public ALB has a format similar to `public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1`.
    ```
    kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Disable the default public ALB. The `--disable-deployment` flag disables the IBM-provided ALB deployment, but doesn't remove the DNS registration for the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain or the load balancer service that is used to expose the Ingress controller.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb-configure --albID <ALB_ID> --disable-deployment
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Get the configuration file for your Ingress controller ready. For example, you can use the YAML configuration file for the [nginx community Ingress controller ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/deploy/mandatory.yaml).

4. Deploy your own Ingress controller. **Important**: To continue to use the load balancer service exposing the controller and the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, your controller must be deployed in the `kube-system` namespace.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f customingress.yaml -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Get the label on your custom Ingress deployment.
    ```
    kubectl get deploy nginx-ingress-controller -n kube-system --show-labels
    ```
    {: pre}

    In the following example output, the label value is `ingress-nginx`:
    ```
    NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       LABELS
    nginx-ingress-controller   1         1         1            1           1m        app=ingress-nginx
    ```
    {: screen}

5. Using the ALB ID you got in step 1, open the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.
    ```
    kubectl edit svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Update the load balancer service to point to your custom Ingress deployment. Under `spec/selector`, remove the ALB ID from the `app` label and add the label for your own Ingress controller that you got in step 5.
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      ...
    spec:
      clusterIP: 172.21.xxx.xxx
      externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
      loadBalancerIP: 169.xx.xxx.xxx
      ports:
      - name: http
        nodePort: 31070
        port: 80
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 80
      - name: https
        nodePort: 31854
        port: 443
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 443
      selector:
        app: <custom_controller_label>
      ...
    ```
    {: codeblock}
    1. Optional: By default, the load balancer service allows traffic on port 80 and 443. If your custom Ingress controller requires a different set of ports, add those ports to the `ports` section.

7. Save and close the configuration file. The output is similar to the following:
    ```
    service "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1" edited
    ```
    {: screen}

8. Verify that the ALB `Selector` now points to your controller.
    ```
    kubectl describe svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    Name:                     public-cre58bff97659a4f41bc927362d5a8ee7a-alb1
    Namespace:                kube-system

8. Deploy any other resources that are required by your custom Ingress controller, such as the configmap.

9. If you have a multizone cluster, repeat these steps for each ALB.

10. Create Ingress resources for your apps by following the steps in [Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public](#ingress_expose_public).

Your apps are now exposed by your custom Ingress controller. To restore the IBM-provided ALB deployment, re-enable the ALB. The ALB is redeployed, and the load balancer service is automatically reconfigured to point to the ALB.

```
ibmcloud ks alb-configure --alb-ID <alb ID> --enable
```
