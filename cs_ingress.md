# Exposing apps with Ingress
{: #ingress}

Expose multiple apps in your Kubernetes cluster by creating Ingress resources that are managed by the IBM-provided application load balancer in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Managing network traffic by using Ingress
{: #planning}

Ingress is a Kubernetes service that balances network traffic workloads in your cluster by forwarding public or private requests to your apps. You can use Ingress to expose multiple app services to the public or to a private network by using a unique public or private route.
{:shortdesc}



Ingress consists of two components:
<dl>
<dt>Application load balancer</dt>
<dd>The application load balancer (ALB) is an external load balancer that listens for incoming HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or UDP service requests and forwards requests to the appropriate app pod. When you create a standard cluster, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} automatically creates a highly available ALB for your cluster and assigns a unique public route to it. The public route is linked to a portable public IP address that is provisioned into your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account during cluster creation. A default private ALB is also automatically created, but is not automatically enabled.</dd>
<dt>Ingress resource</dt>
<dd>To expose an app by using Ingress, you must create a Kubernetes service for your app and register this service with the ALB by defining an Ingress resource. The Ingress resource is a Kubernetes resource that defines the rules for how to route incoming requests for an app. The Ingress resource also specifies the path to your app service, which is appended to the public route to form a unique app URL such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`.
<br></br><strong>Note</strong>: As of 24 May 2018, the Ingress subdomain format changed for new clusters. If you have pipeline dependencies on consistent app domain names, you can use your own custom domain instead of the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain.<ul><li>Clusters created after 24 May 2018 are assigned a subdomain in the new format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.containers.appdomain.cloud</code>.</li><li>Clusters created before 24 May 2018 continue to use the assigned subdomain in the old format, <code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.containers.mybluemix.net</code>.</li></ul></dd>
</dl>

The following diagram shows how Ingress directs communication from the internet to an app:

<img src="images/cs_ingress.png" alt="Expose an app in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} by using Ingress" style="border-style: none"/>

1. A user sends a request to your app by accessing your app's URL. This URL is the public URL for your exposed app appended with the Ingress resource path, such as `mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`.

2. A DNS system service resolves the hostname in the URL to the portable public IP address of the load balancer that exposes the ALB in your cluster.

3. Based on the resolved IP address, the client sends the request to the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.

4. The load balancer service routes the request to the ALB.

5. The ALB checks if a routing rule for the `myapp` path in the cluster exists. If a matching rule is found, the request is forwarded according to the rules that you defined in the Ingress resource to the pod where the app is deployed. If multiple app instances are deployed in the cluster, the ALB load balances the requests between the app pods.



<br />


## Prerequisites
{: #config_prereqs}

Before you get started with Ingress, review the following prerequisites.
{:shortdesc}

**Prerequisites for all Ingress configurations:**
- Ingress is available for standard clusters only and requires at least two worker nodes in the cluster to ensure high availability and that periodic updates are applied.
- Setting up Ingress requires an [Administrator access policy](cs_users.html#access_policies). Verify your current [access policy](cs_users.html#infra_access).



<br />


## Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces
{: #multiple_namespaces}

At least one Ingress resource is required per namespace where you have apps that you want to expose.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>All apps are in one namespace</dt>
<dd>If the apps in your cluster are all in the same namespace, at least one Ingress resource is required to define routing rules for the apps that are exposed there. For example, if you have `app1` and `app2` exposed by services in a development namespace, you can create an Ingress resource in the namespace. The resource specifies `domain.net` as the host and registers the paths that each app listens on with `domain.net`.
<br></br><img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns.png" width="300" alt="At least one resource is required per namespace." style="width:300px; border-style: none"/>
</dd>
<dt>Apps are in multiple namespaces</dt>
<dd>If the apps in your cluster are in different namespaces, you must create at least one resource per namespace to define rules for the apps that are exposed there. To register multiple Ingress resources with the cluster's Ingress ALB, you must use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.domain.net` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can create an Ingress resource in each namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.
<br><br>
For example, consider the following scenario:<ul>
<li>You have two versions of the same app, `app1` and `app3`, for testing purposes.</li>
<li>You deploy the apps in two different namespaces within the same cluster: `app1` into the development namespace, and `app3` into the staging namespace.</li></ul>
To use the same cluster ALB to manage traffic to these apps, you create the following services and resources:<ul>
<li>A Kubernetes service in the development namespace to expose `app1`.</li>
<li>An Ingress resource in the development namespace that specifies the host as `dev.domain.net`.</li>
<li>A Kubernetes service in the staging namespace to expose `app3`.</li>
<li>An Ingress resource in the staging namespace that specifies the host as `stage.domain.net`.</li></ul></br>
<img src="images/cs_ingress_multi_ns.png" alt="Within a namespace, use subdomains in one or multiple resources" style="border-style: none"/>
Now, both URLs resolve to the same domain and are thus both serviced by the same ALB. However, because the resource in the staging namespace is registered with the `stage` subdomain, the Ingress ALB correctly routes requests from the `stage.domain.net/app3` URL to only `app3`.</dd>
</dl>

{: #wildcard_tls}
**Note**:
* The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. For clusters created on or after 6 June 2018, the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the registered wildcard subdomain. For clusters created before 6 June, 2018, TLS certificate will be updated to a wildcard certificate when the current TLS certificate is renewed.
* If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.

### Multiple domains within a namespace

Within an individual namespace, you can use one domain to access all the apps in the namespace. If you want to use different domains for the apps within an individual namespace, use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.mycluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can use one resource to specify multiple subdomain hosts within that resource. Alternatively, you can create multiple Ingress resources in the namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.

<img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns_multi_subs.png" alt="At least one resource is required per namespace." style="border-style: none"/>

**Note**:
* The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. For clusters created on or after 6 June 2018, the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the registered wildcard subdomain. For clusters created before 6 June 2018, TLS certificate will be updated to a wildcard certificate when the current TLS certificate is renewed.
* If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.

## Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public
{: #ingress_expose_public}

Expose apps that are inside your cluster to the public by using the public Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
* [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #public_inside_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   Create a Kubernetes service for each app that you want to expose. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included by the cluster ALB in the Ingress load balancing.
      1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myappservice.yaml`.
      2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: myappservice
          spec:
            selector:
              <selector_key>: <selector_value>
            ports:
             - protocol: TCP
               port: 8080
          ```
          {: codeblock}

          <table>
          <thead>
          <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the ALB service YAML file components</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
          <td><code>selector</code></td>
          <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. To target your pods and include them in the service load balancing, ensure that the <em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em> are the same as the key/value pair in the <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code> section of your deployment yaml.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
           <td><code>port</code></td>
           <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
           </tr>
           </tbody></table>
      3.  Save your changes.
      4.  Create the service in your cluster. If apps are deployed in multiple namespaces in your cluster, ensure that the service deploys into the same namespace as the app that you want to expose.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f myappservice.yaml [-n <namespace>]
          ```
          {: pre}
      5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose.


### Step 2: Select an app domain and TLS termination
{: #public_inside_2}

When you configure the public ALB, you choose the domain that your apps will be accessible through and whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Domain</dt>
<dd>You can use the IBM-provided domain, such as <code>mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp</code>, to access your app from the internet. To use a custom domain instead, you can set up a CNAME record to map your custom domain to the IBM-provided domain or set up an A record with your DNS provider using the ALB's public IP address.</dd>
<dt>TLS termination</dt>
<dd>The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster. If you are using the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, you can use the IBM-provided TLS certificate. If you are using a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination.</dd>
</dl>

To use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:
1. Get the details for your cluster. Replace _&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the apps that you want to expose are deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud cs cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Name:                   mycluster
    ID:                     18a61a63c6a94b658596ca93d087aad9
    State:                  normal
    Created:                2018-01-12T18:33:35+0000
    Location:                 dal10
    Master URL:             https://169.xx.xxx.xxx:26268
    Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
    Ingress Secret:         <tls_secret>
    Workers:                3
    Version:                1.9.8
    Owner Email:            owner@email.com
    Monitoring Dashboard:   <dashboard_URL>
    ```
    {: screen}
2. Get the IBM-provided domain in the **Ingress subdomain** field. If you want to use TLS, also get the IBM-provided TLS secret in the **Ingress Secret** field.
    **Note**: For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls).

To use a custom domain:
1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided ALB. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud cs cluster-get <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the ALB, run `ibmcloud cs alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.
3.   Optional: If you want to use TLS, either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret. If you are using a wildcard domain, ensure that you import or create a wildcard certificate.
      * If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:
        ```
        ibmcloud cs alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
        ```
        {: pre}
      * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2. Create a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;tls_secret_name&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.
          ```
          kubectl create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --key <tls_key_filepath> --cert <tls_cert_filepath>
          ```
          {: pre}


### Step 3: Create the Ingress resource
{: #public_inside_3}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, at least one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2. Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain or your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully.

      ```
      kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
      ```
      {: pre}

      1. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 4: Access your app from the internet
{: #public_inside_4}

In a web browser, enter the URL of the app service to access.

```

## Exposing apps that are outside your cluster to the public
{: #external_endpoint}

Expose apps that are outside your cluster to the public by including them in public Ingress ALB load balancing. Incoming public requests on the IBM-provided or your custom domain are forwarded automatically to the external app.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.
-   Ensure that the external app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing can be accessed by using a public IP address.

### Step 1: Create an app service and external endpoint
{: #public_outside_1}

Start by creating a Kubernetes service to expose the external app and configuring a Kubernetes external endpoint for the app.
{: shortdesc}

1.  Create a Kubernetes service for your cluster that will forward incoming requests to an external endpoint that you will create.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: myexternalservice
        spec:
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>metadata/name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myexternalservice&gt;</em> with a name for your service.<p>Learn more about [securing your personal information](cs_secure.html#pi) when you work with Kubernetes resources.</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>port</code></td>
        <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
        </tr></tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes service for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}
2.  Configure a Kubernetes endpoint that defines the external location of the app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an endpoint configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalendpoint.yaml`.
    2.  Define your external endpoint. Include all public IP addresses and ports that you can use to access your external app.

        ```
        {: pre}

### Step 2: Select an app domain and TLS termination
{: #public_outside_2}

When you configure the public ALB, you choose the domain that your apps will be accessible through and whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Domain</dt>
<dd>You can use the IBM-provided domain, such as <code>mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp</code>, to access your app from the internet. To use a custom domain instead, you can set up a CNAME record to map your custom domain to the IBM-provided domain or set up an A record with your DNS provider using the ALB's public IP address.</dd>
<dt>TLS termination</dt>
<dd>The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster. If you are using the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, you can use the IBM-provided TLS certificate. If you are using a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination.</dd>
</dl>

To use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:
1. Get the details for your cluster. Replace _&lt;cluster_name_or_ID&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the apps that you want to expose are deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud cs cluster-get <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Name:                   mycluster
    ID:                     18a61a63c6a94b658596ca93d087aad9
    State:                  normal
    Created:                2018-01-12T18:33:35+0000
    Location:                 dal10
    Master URL:             https://169.xx.xxx.xxx:26268
    Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-12345.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
    Ingress Secret:         <tls_secret>
    Workers:                3
    Version:                1.9.8
    Owner Email:            owner@email.com
    Monitoring Dashboard:   <dashboard_URL>
    ```
    {: screen}
2. Get the IBM-provided domain in the **Ingress subdomain** field. If you want to use TLS, also get the IBM-provided TLS secret in the **Ingress Secret** field. **Note**: For information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls).

To use a custom domain:
1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided ALB. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud cs cluster-get <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the ALB, run `ibmcloud cs alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.
3.   Optional: If you want to use TLS, either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret. If you are using a wildcard domain, ensure that you import or create a wildcard certificate.
      * If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:
        ```
        ibmcloud cs alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
        ```
        {: pre}
      * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2. Create a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;tls_secret_name&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.
          ```
          kubectl create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --key <tls_key_filepath> --cert <tls_cert_filepath>
          ```
          {: pre}


### Step 3: Create the Ingress resource
{: #public_outside_3}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If you are exposing multiple external apps, and the services you created for the apps in [Step 1](#public_outside_1) are in different namespaces, at least one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalingress.yaml`.

2. Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain or your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myexternalingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<external_app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<external_app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myexternalingress
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<external_app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<external_app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f myexternalingress.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully.

      ```
      kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
      ```
      {: pre}

      1. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 4: Access your app from the internet
{: #public_outside_4}

In a web browser, enter the URL of the app service to access.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>

## Enabling a default private ALB
{: #private_ingress}

When you create a standard cluster, an IBM-provided private application load balancer (ALB) is created and assigned a portable private IP address and a private route. However, the default private ALB is not automatically enabled. To use the default private ALB to load balance private network traffic to your apps, you must first enable it with either the IBM-provided portable private IP address or your own portable private IP address.
{:shortdesc}

**Note**: If you used the `--no-subnet` flag when you created the cluster, then you must add a portable private subnet or a user-managed subnet before you can enable the private ALB. For more information, see [Requesting more subnets for your cluster](cs_subnets.html#request).

Before you begin:

-   Review the options for planning private access to apps when worker nodes are connected to [a public and a private VLAN](cs_network_planning.html#private_both_vlans) or to [a private VLAN only](cs_network_planning.html#private_vlan).
-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster.

To enable a default private ALB by using the pre-assigned, IBM-provided portable private IP address:

1. Get the ID of the default private ALB that you want to enable. Replace <em>&lt;cluster_name&gt;</em> with the name of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.

    ```
    ibmcloud cs albs --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for private ALBs is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP
    private-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1   false     disabled   private   -
    private-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2   false     disabled   private   -
    public-cr6d779503319d419aa3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx
    public-crb2f60e9735254ac8b20b9c1e38b649a5-alb2    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx
    ```
    {: screen}
    

2. Enable the private ALB. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private ALB from the output in the previous step.

   ```
   ibmcloud cs alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable
   ```
   {: pre}

<br>
To enable the private ALB by using your own portable private IP address:

1. Configure the user-managed subnet of your chosen IP address to route traffic on the private VLAN of your cluster.

   ```
   ibmcloud cs cluster-user-subnet-add <cluster_name> <subnet_CIDR> <private_VLAN_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}

   <table>
   <thead>
   <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the command components</th>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;cluster_name&gt;</code></td>
   <td>The name or ID of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;subnet_CIDR&gt;</code></td>
   <td>The CIDR of your user-managed subnet.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><code>&lt;private_VLAN_ID&gt;</code></td>
   <td>An available private VLAN ID. You can find the ID of an available private VLAN by running `ibmcloud cs vlans`.</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody></table>

2. List the available ALBs in your cluster to get the ID of private ALB.

    ```
    ibmcloud cs albs --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for the private ALB is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP
    private-cr6d779503319d419ea3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1   false     disabled   private   -
    public-cr6d779503319d419ea3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx
    ```
    {: screen}
    

3. Enable the private ALB. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private ALB from the output in the previous step and <em>&lt;user_IP&gt;</em> with the IP address from your user-managed subnet that you want to use.

   ```
   ibmcloud cs alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable --user-ip <user_IP>
   ```
   {: pre}

<br />


## Exposing apps to a private network
{: #ingress_expose_private}

Expose apps to a private network by using the private Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:
* Review the options for planning private access to apps when worker nodes are connected to [a public and a private VLAN](cs_network_planning.html#private_both_vlans) or to [a private VLAN only](cs_network_planning.html#private_vlan).
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* [Enable the private application load balancer](#private_ingress).
* If you have private worker nodes and want to use an external DNS provider, you must [configure edge nodes with public access](cs_edge.html#edge) and [configure a Virtual Router Appliance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/kubernetes-and-bluemix-container-based-workloads-part4/).
* If you have private worker nodes and want to remain on a private network only, you must [configure a private, on-premises DNS service ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/) to resolve URL requests to your apps.

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #private_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   Create a Kubernetes service for each app that you want to expose. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included by the cluster ALB in the Ingress load balancing.
      1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myappservice.yaml`.
      2.  Define a service for the app that the ALB will expose.

          ```
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: myappservice
          spec:
            selector:
              <selector_key>: <selector_value>
            ports:
             - protocol: TCP
               port: 8080
          ```
          {: codeblock}

          <table>
          <thead>
          <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the ALB service YAML file components</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          <tr>
          <td><code>selector</code></td>
          <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. To target your pods and include them in the service load balancing, ensure that the <em>&lt;selector_key&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;selector_value&gt;</em> are the same as the key/value pair in the <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code> section of your deployment yaml.</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
           <td><code>port</code></td>
           <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
           </tr>
           </tbody></table>
      3.  Save your changes.
      4.  Create the service in your cluster. If apps are deployed in multiple namespaces in your cluster, ensure that the service deploys into the same namespace as the app that you want to expose.

          ```
          kubectl apply -f myappservice.yaml [-n <namespace>]
          ```
          {: pre}
      5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose.


### Step 2: Map your custom domain and select TLS termination
{: #private_2}

When you configure the private ALB, you use a custom domain that your apps will be accessible through and choose whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to your apps. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to you can use your own TLS certificate to decrypt the network traffic. The ALB then forwards the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.
1.   Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} DNS](/docs/infrastructure/dns/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-dns).
      * If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.

2. Map your custom domain to the portable private IP address of the IBM-provided private ALB by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable private IP address of the private ALB, run `ibmcloud cs albs --cluster <cluster_name>`.
3.   Optional: If you want to use TLS, either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret. If you are using a wildcard domain, ensure that you import or create a wildcard certificate.
      * If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:
        ```
        ibmcloud cs alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
        ```
        {: pre}
      * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2. Create a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;tls_secret_name&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.
          ```
          kubectl create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --key <tls_key_filepath> --cert <tls_cert_filepath>
          ```
          {: pre}


### Step 3: Create the Ingress resource
{: #pivate_3}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, at least one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully.

      ```
      kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
      ```
      {: pre}

      1. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 4: Access your app from your private network
{: #private_4}

From within your private network firewall, enter the URL of the app service in a web browser.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```
{: pre}

If you use a wildcard domain to expose apps in different namespaces, access those apps with their respective subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: pre}

```
http://<subdomain2>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```

## Optional application load balancer configurations
{: #configure_alb}

You can further configure an application load balancer with the following options.

- [Customizing your Ingress resource with annotations](#annotations)
- [Opening ports in the Ingress ALB](#opening_ingress_ports)
- [Preserving the source IP address](#preserve_source_ip)
- [Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level](#ssl_protocols_ciphers)
- [Customizing the Ingress log format](#ingress_log_format)
- [Increasing the size of the shared memory zone for Ingress metrics collection](#vts_zone_size)
{: #ingress_annotation}

### Customizing your Ingress resource with annotations
{: #annotations}

To add capabilities to your Ingress application load balancer (ALB), you can specify annotations as metadata in an Ingress resource.
{: short desc}

Get started with some of the most commonly used annotations.
* [redirect-to-https](cs_annotations.html#redirect-to-https): Convert insecure HTTP client requests to HTTPS.
* [rewrite-path](cs_annotations.html#rewrite-path): Route incoming network traffic to a different path that your backend app listens on.
* [ssl-services](cs_annotations.html#ssl-services): Allow SSL services support to encrypt traffic to your upstream apps that require HTTPS.
* [client-max-body-size](cs_annotations.html#client-max-body-size): Set the maximum size of the body that the client can send as part of a request.

For the full list of supported annotations, see [Ingress annotations](cs_annotations.html).

### Opening ports in the Ingress application load balancer
{: #opening_ingress_ports}

By default, only ports 80 and 443 are exposed in the Ingress ALB. To expose other ports, you can edit the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.
{:shortdesc}

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add a <code>data</code> section and specify public ports `80`, `443`, and any other ports you want to expose separated by a semi-colon (;).

    **Important**: By default, ports 80 and 443 are open. If you want to keep 80 and 443 open, you must also include them in addition to any other ports you specify in the `public-ports` field. Any port that is not specified is closed. If you enabled a private ALB, you must also specify any ports that you want to keep open in the `private-ports` field.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;<port3>"
      private-ports: "80;443;<port4>"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example that keeps ports `80`, `443`, and `9443` open:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      public-ports: "80;443;9443"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

 ```
 kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
 ```
 {: pre}

For more information about configmap resources, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/).

### Preserving the source IP address
{: #preserve_source_ip}

By default, the source IP address of the client request is not preserved. When a client request to your app is sent to your cluster, the request is routed to a pod for the load balancer service that exposes the ALB. If no app pod exists on the same worker node as the load balancer service pod, the load balancer forwards the request to an app pod on a different worker node. The source IP address of the package is changed to the public IP address of the worker node where the app pod is running.

To preserve the original source IP address of the client request, you can [enable source IP preservation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/source-ip/#source-ip-for-services-with-typeloadbalancer). Preserving the client’s IP is useful, for example, when app servers have to apply security and access-control policies.

**Note**: If you [disable an ALB](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_alb_configure), any source IP changes you make to the load balancer service exposing the ALB are lost. When you re-enable the ALB, you must enable source IP again.

To enable source IP preservation, edit the load balancer service that exposes an Ingress ALB:


1. Get the ID of the ALB for which you want to enable source IP. The ALB services have a format similar to `public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a public ALB or `private-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1` for a private ALB.
    ```
    kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Open the load balancer service that exposes the ALB.
    ```
    kubectl edit svc <ALB_ID> -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Under **spec**, change the value of **externalTrafficPolicy** from `Cluster` to `Local`.

4. Save and close the configuration file. The output is similar to the following:

    ```
    service "public-cr18e61e63c6e94b658596ca93d087eed9-alb1" edited
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Verify that the source IP is being preserved in your ALB pods logs.
    1. Get the ID of a pod for the ALB that you modified.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep alb
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Open the logs for that ALB pod. Verify that the IP address for the `client` field is the client request IP address instead of the load balancer service IP address.
        ```
        kubectl logs <ALB_pod_ID> nginx-ingress -n kube-system
        ```
        {: pre}

3. Now, when you look up the headers for the requests sent to your backend app, you can see the client IP address in the `x-forwarded-for` header.

4. If you no longer want to preserve the source IP, you can revert the changes you made to the service.
    * To revert source IP preservation for your public ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^public" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}
    * To revert source IP preservation for your private ALBs:
        ```
        kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep alb | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^private" | while read alb; do kubectl patch svc $alb -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'; done
        ```
        {: pre}

### Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level
{: #ssl_protocols_ciphers}

Enable SSL protocols and ciphers at the global HTTP level by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap.
{:shortdesc}

By default, the TLS 1.2 protocol is used for all Ingress configurations that use the IBM-provided domain. You can override the default to instead use TLS 1.1 or 1.0 protocols by following these steps.

**Note**: When you specify the enabled protocols for all hosts, the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 parameters (1.1.13, 1.0.12) work only when OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is used. The TLSv1.3 parameter (1.13.0) works only when OpenSSL 1.1.1 built with TLSv1.3 support is used.

To edit the configmap to enable SSL protocols and ciphers:

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add the SSL protocols and ciphers. Format ciphers according to the [OpenSSL library cipher list format ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html).

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ssl-protocols: "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
     ssl-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

### Customizing Ingress log content and format
{: #ingress_log_format}

You can customize the content and format of logs that are collected for the Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

By default, Ingress logs are formatted in JSON and display common log fields. However, you can also create a custom log format. To choose which log components are forwarded and how the components are arranged in the log output:

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add a <code>data</code> section. Add the `log-format` field and optionally, the `log-format-escape-json` field.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      log-format: '{<key1>: <log_variable1>, <key2>: <log_variable2>, <key3>: <log_variable3>}'
      log-format-escape-json: "true"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

    <table>
    <caption>YAML file components</caption>
    <thead>
    <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the log-format configuration</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><code>log-format</code></td>
    <td>Replace <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> with the name for the log component and <code>&lt;log_variable&gt;</code> with a variable for the log component that you want to collect in log entries. You can include text and punctuation that you want the log entry to contain, such as quotation marks around string values and commas to separate log components. For example, formatting a component like <code>request: "$request",</code> generates the following in a log entry: <code>request: "GET / HTTP/1.1",</code> . For a list of all the variables you can use, see the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html">Nginx variable index</a>.<br><br>To log an additional header such as <em>x-custom-ID</em>, add the following key-value pair to the custom log content: <br><pre class="pre"><code>customID: $http_x_custom_id</code></pre> <br>Hyphens (<code>-</code>) are converted to underscores (<code>_</code>) and <code>$http_</code> must be prepended to the custom header name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>log-format-escape-json</code></td>
    <td>Optional: By default, logs are generated in text format. To generate logs in JSON format, add the <code>log-format-escape-json</code> field and use value <code>true</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    For example, your log format might contain the following variables:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      log-format: '{remote_address: $remote_addr, remote_user: "$remote_user",
                    time_date: [$time_local], request: "$request",
                    status: $status, http_referer: "$http_referer",
                    http_user_agent: "$http_user_agent",
                    request_id: $request_id}'
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: screen}

    A log entry according to this format looks like the following example:
    ```
    remote_address: 127.0.0.1, remote_user: "dbmanager", time_date: [30/Mar/2018:18:52:17 +0000], request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", status: 401, http_referer: "-", http_user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0", request_id: a02b2dea9cf06344a25611c1d7ad72db
    ```
    {: screen}

    To create a custom log format that is based on the default format for ALB logs, modify the following section as needed and add it to your configmap:
    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      log-format: '{"time_date": "$time_iso8601", "client": "$remote_addr",
                    "host": "$http_host", "scheme": "$scheme",
                    "request_method": "$request_method", "request_uri": "$uri",
                    "request_id": "$request_id", "status": $status,
                    "upstream_addr": "$upstream_addr", "upstream_status":
                    $upstream_status, "request_time": $request_time,
                    "upstream_response_time": $upstream_response_time,
                    "upstream_connect_time": $upstream_connect_time,
                    "upstream_header_time": $upstream_header_time}'
      log-format-escape-json: "true"
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
      namespace: kube-system
    ```
    {: codeblock}

4. Save the configuration file.

5. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

4. To view the Ingress ALB logs, choose between two options.
    * [Create a logging configuration for the Ingress service](cs_health.html#logging) in your cluster.
    * Check the logs from the CLI.
        1. Get the ID of a pod for an ALB.
            ```
            kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep alb
            ```
            {: pre}

        2. Open the logs for that ALB pod. Verify that logs follow the updated format.
            ```
            kubectl logs <ALB_pod_ID> nginx-ingress -n kube-system
            ```
            {: pre}

### Increasing the size of the shared memory zone for Ingress metrics collection
{: #vts_zone_size}

Shared memory zones are defined so that worker processes can share information such as cache, session persistence, and rate limits. A shared memory zone, called the virtual host traffic status zone, is set up for Ingress to collect metrics data for an ALB.
{:shortdesc}

In the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` Ingress configmap, the `vts-status-zone-size` field sets the size of the shared memory zone for metrics data collection. By default, `vts-status-zone-size` is set to `10m`. If you have a large environment that requires more memory for metrics collection, you can override the default to instead use a larger value by following these steps.

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` configmap resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Change the value of `vts-status-zone-size` from `10m` to a larger value.

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     vts-status-zone-size: "10m"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Save the configuration file.

4. Verify that the configmap changes were applied.

   ```
   kubectl get cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
   {: pre}
