# Setting up Ingress
{: #ingress}

Expose multiple apps in your Kubernetes cluster by creating Ingress resources that are managed by the IBM-provided application load balancer in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #config_prereqs}

Before you get started with Ingress, review the following prerequisites.
{:shortdesc}

- Classic clusters: Enable a [Virtual Router Function (VRF)](/docs/dl?topic=dl-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud) for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. To enable VRF, [contact your IBM Cloud infrastructure account representative](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud#benefits-of-moving-to-vrf). To check whether a VRF is already enabled, use the `ibmcloud account show` command. If you cannot or do not want to enable VRF, enable [VLAN spanning](/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning). When a VRF or VLAN spanning is enabled, the ALB can route packets to various subnets in the account.
- Setting up Ingress requires the following [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM roles](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform):
    - **Administrator** platform role for the cluster
    - **Manager** service role in all namespaces
- Ingress is available for standard clusters only and requires at least two worker nodes per zone to ensure high availability and that periodic updates are applied. If you have only one worker in a zone, the ALB cannot receive automatic updates. When automatic updates are rolled out to ALB pods, the pod is reloaded. However, ALB pods have anti-affinity rules to ensure that only one pod is scheduled to each worker node for high availability. Because there is only one ALB pod on one worker, the pod is not restarted so that traffic is not interrupted. The ALB pod is updated to the latest version only when you delete the old pod manually so that the new, updated pod can be scheduled.
- If you restrict network traffic to edge worker nodes, ensure that at least two [edge worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-edge) are enabled in each zone so that ALBs deploy uniformly.
- To be included in Ingress load balancing, the names of the `ClusterIP` services that expose your apps must be unique across all namespaces in your cluster.
- If a zone fails, you might see intermittent failures in requests to the Ingress ALB in that zone.

## Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces
{: #multiple_namespaces}

One Ingress resource is required per namespace where you have apps that you want to expose.
{:shortdesc}

### All apps are in one namespace
{: #one-ns}

If the apps in your cluster are all in the same namespace, one Ingress resource is required to define routing rules for the apps that are exposed there.
{: shortdesc}

For example, if you have `app1` and `app2` exposed by services in a development namespace, you can create an Ingress resource in the namespace. The resource specifies `domain.net` as the host and registers the paths that each app listens on with `domain.net`.

<img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns.png" width="270" alt="One resource is required per namespace." style="width:270px; border-style: none"/>

### Apps are in multiple namespaces
{: #multi-ns}

If the apps in your cluster are in different namespaces, you must create one resource per namespace to define rules for the apps that are exposed there.
{: shortdesc}

However, you can define a hostname in only one resource. You cannot define the same hostname in multiple resources. To register multiple Ingress resources with the same hostname, you must use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.domain.net` is registered, multiple subdomains can all resolve to the same host. Then, you can create an Ingress resource in each namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.

For example, consider the following scenario:
* You have two versions of the same app, `app1` and `app3`, for testing purposes.
* You deploy the apps in two different namespaces within the same cluster: `app1` into the development namespace, and `app3` into the staging namespace.

To use the same cluster ALB to manage traffic to these apps, you create the following services and resources:
* A Kubernetes service in the development namespace to expose `app1`.
* An Ingress resource in the development namespace that specifies the host as `dev.domain.net`.
* A Kubernetes service in the staging namespace to expose `app3`.
* An Ingress resource in the staging namespace that specifies the host as `stage.domain.net`.
</br>
<img src="images/cs_ingress_multi_ns.png" width="625" alt="Within a namespace, use subdomains in one or multiple resources" style="width:625px; border-style: none"/>

Now, both URLs resolve to the same domain and are thus both serviced by the same ALB. However, because the resource in the staging namespace is registered with the `stage` subdomain, the Ingress ALB correctly routes requests from the `stage.domain.net/app3` URL to only `app3`.

{: #wildcard_tls}
The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<globally_unique_account_HASH>-0000.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. The IBM-provided TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the wildcard subdomain. If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.
{: note}

### Multiple domains within a namespace
{: #multi-domains}

Within an individual namespace, you can use one domain to access all the apps in the namespace. If you want to use different domains for the apps within an individual namespace, use a wildcard domain. When a wildcard domain such as `*.mycluster-<hash>-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud` is registered, multiple subdomains all resolve to the same host. Then, you can use one resource to specify multiple subdomain hosts within that resource. Alternatively, you can create multiple Ingress resources in the namespace and specify a different subdomain in each Ingress resource.
{: shortdesc}

<img src="images/cs_ingress_single_ns_multi_subs.png" width="625" alt="One resource is required per namespace." style="width:625px; border-style: none"/>

The IBM-provided Ingress subdomain wildcard, `*.<cluster_name>.<globally_unique_account_HASH>-0000.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud`, is registered by default for your cluster. The IBM-provided TLS certificate is a wildcard certificate and can be used for the wildcard subdomain. If you want to use a custom domain, you must register the custom domain as a wildcard domain such as `*.custom_domain.net`. To use TLS, you must get a wildcard certificate.
{: note}

<br />


## Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public
{: #ingress_expose_public}

Expose apps that are inside your cluster to the public by using the public Ingress ALB.
{:shortdesc}

**Before you begin:**

* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
* VPC clusters: If you use VPC Generation 2 compute, or if you use VPC Generation 1 compute and created non-default VPC security groups, [allow traffic requests that are routed by Ingress to node ports on your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy#security_groups).

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #public_inside_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_app#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app runs so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   For each app deployment that you want to expose, create a Kubernetes `ClusterIP` service. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included in the Ingress load balancing.
      ```
      kubectl expose deploy <app_deployment_name> --name my-app-svc --port <app_port> -n <namespace>
      ```
      {: pre}


### Step 2: Select an app domain
{: #public_inside_2}

When you configure the public ALB, you choose the domain that your apps will be accessible through.
{: shortdesc}

You can use the IBM-provided domain, such as `mycluster-<hash>-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/myapp`, to access your app from the internet. To use a custom domain instead, you can set up a CNAME record to map your custom domain to the IBM-provided domain.

**To use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:**

Get the IBM-provided domain. Replace `<cluster_name_or_ID>` with the name of the cluster where the app is deployed.
```
ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep Ingress
```
{: pre}

Example output:
```
Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-<hash>-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
Ingress Secret:         mycluster-<hash>-0000
```
{: screen}

**To use a custom domain:**
1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS](/docs/dns?topic=dns-getting-started). If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`. Note that domains are limited to 255 characters or fewer.

2.  Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field.

### Step 3: Select TLS termination
{: #public_inside_3}

After you choose the app domain, you choose whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.

* If you use the IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, you can use the IBM-provided TLS certificate, which is stored as a Kubernetes secret in the `default` namespace. IBM-provided TLS certificates are signed by LetsEncrypt and are fully managed by IBM. The certificates expire every 90 days and are automatically renewed 37 days before they expire. For more information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls).
* If you use a custom domain, you can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination. The ALB first checks for a secret in the namespace that the app is in, then in `default`, and finally in `ibm-cert-store`. If you have apps in one namespace only, you can import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in that same namespace. If you have apps in multiple namespaces, import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in the `default` namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in every namespace. In the Ingress resources that you define for each namespace, specify the name of the secret that is in the default namespace. For more information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls). **Note**: TLS certificates that contain pre-shared keys (TLS-PSK) are not supported.

**If you use the IBM-provided Ingress domain:**

Get the IBM-provided TLS secret for your cluster.
```
ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep Ingress
```
{: pre}

Example output:
```
Ingress Subdomain:      mycluster-<hash>-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
Ingress Secret:         mycluster-<hash>-0000
```
{: screen}
</br>

**If you use a custom domain:**

If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:

```
ibmcloud ks alb cert deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
```
{: pre}

Do not create the secret with the same name as the IBM-provided Ingress secret, which you can find by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep Ingress`.
{: note}

When you import a certificate with this command, the certificate secret is created in a namespace called `ibm-cert-store`. A reference to this secret is then created in the `default` namespace, which any Ingress resource in any namespace can access. When the ALB is processing requests, it follows this reference to pick up and use the certificate secret from the `ibm-cert-store` namespace.

The certificate is also registered with {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}}, which enables you to track usage of the certificate. The certificate's description is appended with the cluster ID and the secret name in the format `k8s:cluster:<cluster-ID>:secret:<ALB-certificate-secret-name>`.

</br>

If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
1. Generate a certificate authority (CA) cert and key from your certificate provider. If you have your own domain, purchase an official TLS certificate for your domain. Make sure the [CN](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name/){: external} is different for each certificate.
2. Convert the cert and key into base64.
   1. Encode the cert and key into base64 and save the base64 encoded value in a new file.
      ```
      openssl base64 -in tls.key -out tls.key.base64
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. View the base64 encoded value for your cert and key.
      ```
      cat tls.key.base64
      ```
      {: pre}

3. Create a secret YAML file using the cert and key.
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: ssl-my-test
     type: Opaque
     data:
       tls.crt: <client_certificate>
       tls.key: <client_key>
     ```
     {: codeblock}

4. Create a Kubernetes secret for your certificate.
     ```
     kubectl apply -f ssl-my-test
     ```
     {: pre}
     Do not create the secret with the same name as the IBM-provided Ingress secret, which you can find by running `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> | grep Ingress`.
     {: note}


### Step 4: Create the Ingress resource
{: #public_inside_4}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).
{: note}

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2. Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain or your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

    <td><code>servicePort</code></td>
    <td>The port that your service listens to. Use the same port that you defined when you created the Kubernetes service for your app.</td>

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.

    ```
    kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
    ```
    {: pre}


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.

### Step 5: Access your app from the internet
{: #public_inside_5}

In a web browser, enter the URL of the app service to access.
{: shortdesc}

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```

If you use a wildcard domain, access those apps with their own subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>

## Exposing apps that are outside your cluster to the public
{: #external_endpoint}

Expose apps that are outside your cluster to the public by including them in public Ingress ALB load balancing. Incoming public requests on the IBM-provided or your custom domain are forwarded automatically to the external app.
{: shortdesc}

You have two options for setting up routing to an external app:
* To forward requests directly to the IP address of your external service, [set up a Kubernetes endpoint](#external_ip) that defines the external IP address and port of the app.
* To route requests through the Ingress ALB to your external service, [use the `proxy-external-service` annotation](#proxy-external) in your Ingress resource file.

### Exposing external apps through a Kubernetes endpoint
{: #external_ip}

Forward requests directly to the IP address of your external service by setting up a Kubernetes endpoint that defines the external IP address and port of the app.
{: shortdesc}

**Before you begin:**
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* Ensure that the external app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing can be accessed by using a public IP address.
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
* VPC clusters: In order to forward requests to the public external endpoint of your app, your VPC subnets must have a public gateway attached.
* VPC clusters: If you use VPC Generation 2 compute, or if you use VPC Generation 1 compute and created non-default VPC security groups, [allow traffic requests that are routed by Ingress to node ports on your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy#security_groups).

To expose apps that are outside of your cluster to the public:
1.  Define a Kubernetes service configuration file for the app that the ALB will expose. This service forwards incoming requests to an external endpoint that you create in subsequent steps.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: myexternalservice
    spec:
      ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: <app_port>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2.  Create the service in your cluster.
    ```
    oc apply -f myexternalservice.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3.  Define an external endpoint configuration file. Include all public IP addresses and ports that you can use to access your external app. Note that the name of the endpoint must be the same as the name of the service that you defined in the previous step, `myexternalservice`.

    ```yaml
    kind: Endpoints
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: myexternalservice
    subsets:
      - addresses:
          - ip: <external_IP1>
          - ip: <external_IP2>
        ports:
          - port: <external_port>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    <table>
    <thead>
    <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><code>name</code></td>
    <td>Replace <em><code>&lt;myexternalendpoint&gt;</code></em> with the name of the Kubernetes service that you created earlier.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>ip</code></td>
    <td>Replace <em>&lt;external_IP&gt;</em> with the public IP addresses to connect to your external app.</td>
     </tr>
     <td><code>port</code></td>
     <td>Replace <em>&lt;external_port&gt;</em> with the port that your external app listens to.</td>
     </tbody></table>

4.  Create the endpoint in your cluster.
    ```
    oc apply -f myexternalendpoint.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Continue with the steps in "Exposing apps that are inside your cluster to the public", [Step 2: Select an app domain](#public_inside_2).

### Exposing external apps through the `proxy-external-service` Ingress annotation
{: #proxy-external}

Route requests through the Ingress ALB to your external service by using the `proxy-external-service` annotation in your Ingress resource file.
{: shortdesc}

**Before you begin:**
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* VPC clusters: In order to forward requests to the public external endpoint of your app, your VPC subnets must have a public gateway attached.
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To expose apps that are outside of your cluster to the public:

1. [Choose the app domain](#public_inside_2) that you want the external service to be accessible from.

2. Create an Ingress resource file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: myingress
    annotations:
      ingress.bluemix.net/proxy-external-service: "path=<mypath> external-svc=https:<external_service> host=<ingress_subdomain>"
  spec:
    rules:

## Classic clusters: Exposing apps to a private network
{: #ingress_expose_private}

Expose apps to a private network by using the private Ingress ALBs in a classic cluster.
{:shortdesc}

To use a private ALB, you must first enable the private ALB. Because private VLAN-only classic clusters are not assigned an IBM-provided Ingress subdomain, no Ingress secret is created during cluster setup. To expose your apps to the private network, you must register your ALB with a custom domain and, optionally, import your own TLS certificate.

**Before you begin:**
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* If you have a classic cluster with worker nodes that are connected to [a private VLAN only](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#plan_private_vlan) you must configure a [DNS service that is available on the private network](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/){: external}.

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #private_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_app#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app runs so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   For each app deployment that you want to expose, create a Kubernetes `ClusterIP` service. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included in the Ingress load balancing.
      ```
      kubectl expose deploy <app_deployment_name> --name my-app-svc --port <app_port> -n <namespace>
      ```
      {: pre}


</br>

### Step 2: Enable the default private ALB
{: #private_ingress}

When you create a standard cluster, a private ALB is created in each zone that you have worker nodes and assigned a private IP address. However, the default private ALB in each zone is not automatically enabled. You must first enable each private ALB.
{:shortdesc}

1. Get the private ALB IDs for your cluster.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb ls --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for private ALBs is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP          Zone    Build                          ALB VLAN ID   NLB Version
    private-crdf253b6025d64944ab99ed63bb4567b6-alb1   false     disabled   private   -               dal10   ingress:411/ingress-auth:315   2234947       -
    public-crdf253b6025d64944ab99ed63bb4567b6-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.xx.xxx.xxx  dal10   ingress:411/ingress-auth:315   2234945       -
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Enable the private ALBs. Run this command for the ID of each private ALB that you want to enable. If you want to specify an IP address for the ALB, include the IP address in the `--user-ip` flag.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb configure classic --alb-id <private_ALB_ID> --enable
  ```
  {: pre}
  </br>

### Step 3: Map your custom domain
{: #private_3}

When you configure the private ALBs, you must expose your apps by using a custom domain.
{: shortdesc}

**Private VLAN-only classic clusters:**

1. Configure your own [DNS service that is available on your private network](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/){: external}.
2. Create a custom domain through your DNS provider. If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`.
3. Using your private DNS service, map your custom domain to the portable private IP addresses of the ALBs by adding the IP addresses as A records. To find the portable private IP addresses of the ALBs, run `ibmcloud ks alb get --alb-id <private_alb_ID>` for each ALB. </br>

**Private and public VLAN classic clusters:**

1.    Create a custom domain. To register your custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider or [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS](/docs/dns?topic=dns-getting-started). If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as `*.custom_domain.net`. Note that domains are limited to 255 characters or fewer.

2.  Map your custom domain to the portable private IP addresses of the ALBs by adding the IP addresses as A records. To find the portable private IP addresses of the ALBs, run `ibmcloud ks alb get --alb-id  <private_alb_ID>` for each ALB.
</br>

### Step 4: Select TLS termination
{: #private_4}

After you map your custom domain, choose whether to use TLS termination.
{: shortdesc}

The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS connections, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.

Because private VLAN-only clusters are not assigned an IBM-provided Ingress domain, no Ingress secret is created during the cluster setup. You can use your own TLS certificate to manage TLS termination.  The ALB first checks for a secret in the namespace that the app is in, then in `default`, and finally in `ibm-cert-store`. If you have apps in one namespace only, you can import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in that same namespace. If you have apps in multiple namespaces, import or create a TLS secret for the certificate in the `default` namespace so that the ALB can access and use the certificate in every namespace. In the Ingress resources that you define for each namespace, specify the name of the secret that is in the default namespace. For more information about wildcard TLS certification, see [this note](#wildcard_tls). **Note**: TLS certificates that contain pre-shared keys (TLS-PSK) are not supported.

If a TLS certificate is stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:

```
ibmcloud ks alb cert deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
```
{: pre}

When you import a certificate with this command, the certificate secret is created in a namespace called `ibm-cert-store`. A reference to this secret is then created in the `default` namespace, which any Ingress resource in any namespace can access. When the ALB is processing requests, it follows this reference to pick up and use the certificate secret from the `ibm-cert-store` namespace.
</br>

### Step 5: Create the Ingress resource
{: #private_5}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, one Ingress resource is required per namespace. However, each namespace must use a different host. You must register a wildcard domain and specify a different subdomain in each resource. For more information, see [Planning networking for single or multiple namespaces](#multiple_namespaces).
{: note}

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID_1>;<private_ALB_ID_2>"
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Example YAML that uses TLS:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:
        ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID_1>;<private_ALB_ID_2>"
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
        - <domain>
        secretName: <tls_secret_name>
      rules:
      - host: <domain>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /<app1_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app1_service>
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /<app2_path>
            backend:
              serviceName: <app2_service>
              servicePort: 80
    ```

    <td><code>servicePort</code></td>
    <td>The port that your service listens to. Use the same port that you defined when you created the Kubernetes service for your app.</td>

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.

    ```
    kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
    ```
    {: pre}


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.
</br>

### Step 6: Access your app from your private network
{: #private_6}

1. Before you can access your app, make sure that you can access a DNS service.
  * Public and private VLAN: To use the default external DNS provider, you must [configure edge nodes with public access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-edge#edge) and [configure a Virtual Router Appliance](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-archive/2017/07/kubernetes-and-bluemix-container-based-workloads-part4/){: external}.
  * Private VLAN only: You must configure a [DNS service that is available on the private network](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/){: external}.

2. From within your private network firewall, enter the URL of the app service in a web browser.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```
{: codeblock}

If you use a wildcard domain, access those apps with their own subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}

```
http://<subdomain2>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}


<p class="tip">Having trouble connecting to your app through Ingress? Try [Troubleshooting Ingress](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_debug_ingress). You can check the health and status of your Ingress components by running `ibmcloud ks ingress status -c <cluster_name_or_ID>`.</p>

### Optional: Block traffic to public NodePorts
{: #block-nodeports}

In clusters that are connected to public and private VLANs, block traffic to public NodePorts.
{: shortdesc}

Ingress ALBs make your app available over both the ALB IP address and port, and the service's NodePorts. NodePorts are accessible on every IP address (public and private) for every node within the cluster. If your cluster is attached to both public and private VLANs, an ALB with a portable private IP address still has a public NodePort open on every worker node. Create a [Calico preDNAT network policy](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies#block_ingress) to block traffic to the public NodePorts.

<br />


## VPC clusters: Exposing apps to a private network
{: #ingress_expose_vpc_private}

Expose apps to a private network by using the private Ingress ALBs in a VPC cluster.
{:shortdesc}

To use a private ALB, you must first enable the private ALB. Then, to expose your apps to the private network, you must create a DNS entry for your private ALB hostname.

**Before you begin**:
* Review the Ingress [prerequisites](#config_prereqs).
* [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
* If you use VPC Generation 2 compute, or if you use VPC Generation 1 compute and created non-default VPC security groups, [allow traffic requests that are routed by Ingress to node ports on your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy#security_groups).

### Step 1: Deploy apps and create app services
{: #vpc_private_1}

Start by deploying your apps and creating Kubernetes services to expose them.
{: shortdesc}

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-deploy_app#app_cli). Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file, such as `app: code`. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app runs so that the pods can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

2.   For each app deployment that you want to expose, create a Kubernetes `ClusterIP` service. Your app must be exposed by a Kubernetes service to be included in the Ingress load balancing.
      ```
      kubectl expose deploy <app_deployment_name> --name my-app-svc --port <app_port> -n <namespace>
      ```
      {: pre}


</br>

### Step 2: Enable the default private ALBs
{: #vpc_private_2}

When you create a standard cluster, a private ALB is created in each zone that you have worker nodes. However, the default private ALB in each zone is not automatically enabled. You must first enable each private ALB.
{:shortdesc}

1. Get the private ALB IDs for your cluster.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb ls --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for private ALBs is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                Enabled    Status     Type      Load Balancer Hostname                 Zone         Build
    private-crbl25g33d0if1cmfn0p8g-alb1   false      disabled   private   -                                      us-south-1   ingress:524/ingress-auth:340
    private-crbl25g33d0if1cmfn0p8g-alb2   false      disabled   private   -                                      us-south-2   ingress:524/ingress-auth:340
    public-crbl25g33d0if1cmfn0p8g-alb1    true       enabled    public    0bcc2ab2-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud   us-south-1   ingress:524/ingress-auth:340
    public-crbl25g33d0if1cmfn0p8g-alb2    true       enabled    public    0bcc2ab2-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud   us-south-2   ingress:524/ingress-auth:340
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Enable the private ALBs. Run this command for the ID of each private ALB that you want to enable.
  * VPC Gen 1 clusters:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb configure vpc-classic --alb-id <ALB_ID> --enable
    ```
    {: pre}
  * VPC Gen 2 clusters:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks alb configure vpc-gen2 --alb-id <ALB_ID> --enable
    ```
    {: pre}
  </br>

### Step 3: Create a subdomain to register the ALBs with a DNS entry and create an SSL certificate
{: #vpc_private_3}

When you enable the private ALBs, one private VPC load balancer is automatically created outside of your cluster in your VPC. The private VPC load balancer puts the private IP addresses of your private ALBs behind one hostname. You must create a DNS entry for this hostname by creating a subdomain. When you create the subdomain, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} also generates and maintains a wildcard SSL certificate for the subdomain for you.
{: shortdesc}

1. Get the hostname that is assigned to your private ALBs by the VPC load balancer. In the output, look for the **Load Balancer Hostname** field of your private ALBs.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks alb ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:
  ```
  ALB ID                                Enabled   Status    Type      Load Balancer Hostname                 Zone         Build
  private-crbl25g33d0if1cmfn0p8g-alb1   true      enabled   private   1234abcd-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud   us-south-1   ingress:524/ingress-auth:340
  private-crbl25g33d0if1cmfn0p8g-alb2   true      enabled   private   1234abcd-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud   us-south-2   ingress:524/ingress-auth:340
  ```
  {: screen}

2. Create a DNS subdomain for the private ALB hostname.
  * VPC Gen 1:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks nlb-dns create vpc-classic --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --lb-host <vpc_lb_hostname> --type private
    ```
    {: pre}
  * VPC Gen 2:
    ```
    ibmcloud ks nlb-dns create vpc-gen2 --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --lb-host <vpc_lb_hostname> --type private
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the subdomain is created.
  ```
  ibmcloud ks nlb-dns ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:
  ```
  Subdomain                                                                               Load Balancer Hostname                        Health Monitor   SSL Cert Status           SSL Cert Secret Name
  mycluster-a1b2cdef345678g9hi012j3kl4567890-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud     ["1234abcd-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud"]      None             created                   <certificate>
  ```
  {: screen}

4. Choose whether to use TLS termination for your ALBs. The ALB load balances HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster. To also load balance incoming HTTPS traffic, you can configure the ALB to decrypt the network traffic and forward the decrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster. If you want to use TLS termination, note the name of the certificate in the output of the previous step.
</br>

### Step 4: Create the Ingress resource
{: #vpc_private_4}

Ingress resources define the routing rules that the ALB uses to route traffic to your app service.
{: shortdesc}

If your cluster has multiple namespaces where apps are exposed, one Ingress resource is required for each namespace. The Ingress resource determines the host that is appended to your app and that builds the URL to access your app. The Ingress host must be unique in each Ingress resource that you create. The DNS subdomain that you created in the previous step is registered as a wildcard domain. You can use this domain to build multiple Ingress hosts for your Ingress resource. For example, if your subdomain is `mycluster-a1b2cdef345678g9hi012j3kl4567890-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud`, you can build multiple Ingress hosts by adding a custom value as a prefix to the subdomain, such as `example1.mycluster-a1b2cdef345678g9hi012j3kl4567890-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud`.
{: note}

1. Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingressresource.yaml`.

2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to the services that you created earlier.

    Example YAML that does not use TLS:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: myingressresource
      annotations:

    <tr>
    <td><code>path</code></td>
    <td>Replace <em>&lt;app_path&gt;</em> with a forward slash or the path that your app is listening on. The path is appended to your domain to create a unique route to your app. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the ALB. The ALB looks up the associated service and sends network traffic to the service. The service then forwards the traffic to the pods where the app runs.
    </br></br>
    Many apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as <code>/</code> and do not specify an individual path for your app. Examples: <ul><li>For <code>http://domain/</code>, enter <code>/</code> as the path.</li><li>For <code>http://domain/app1_path</code>, enter <code>/app1_path</code> as the path.</li></ul>
    <p class="tip">To configure Ingress to listen on a path that is different than the path that your app listens on, you can use the [rewrite annotation](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ingress_annotation#rewrite-path).</p></td>

    <td><code>serviceName</code></td>
    <td>Replace <em>&lt;app1_service&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;app2_service&gt;</em>, and so on, with the name of the services you created to expose your apps. If your apps are exposed by services in different namespaces in the cluster, include only app services that are in the same namespace. You must create one Ingress resource for each namespace where you have apps that you want to expose.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>servicePort</code></td>
    <td>The port that your service listens to. Use the same port that you defined when you created the Kubernetes service for your app.</td>

3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster. Ensure that the resource deploys into the same namespace as the app services that you specified in the resource.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f myingressresource.yaml -n <namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}
4.   Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully. If messages in the events describe an error in your resource configuration, change the values in your resource file and reapply the file for the resource.

    ```
    kubectl describe ingress myingressresource
    ```
    {: pre}


Your Ingress resource is created in the same namespace as your app services. Your apps in this namespace are registered with the cluster's Ingress ALB.
</br>

### Step 5: Access your app from your private network
{: #vpc_private_5}

From within your private network, enter the URL of the app service in a web browser.

```
https://<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}

If you exposed multiple apps, access those apps by changing the path that is appended to the URL.

```
https://<domain>/<app2_path>
```
{: codeblock}

If you use a wildcard domain, access those apps with their own subdomains.

```
http://<subdomain1>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}

```
http://<subdomain2>.<domain>/<app1_path>
```
{: codeblock}


<p class="tip">Having trouble connecting to your app through Ingress? Try [Troubleshooting Ingress](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_debug_ingress). You can check the health and status of your Ingress components by running `ibmcloud ks ingress status -c <cluster_name_or_ID>`.</p>
