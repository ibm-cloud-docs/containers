# (Deprecated) Version 1.20 CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
{: #cis-benchmark-120}

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) publishes the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/){: external} as a framework of specific steps to configure Kubernetes more securely and with standards that are commensurate to various industry regulations. This document contains the results of the version 1.5 CIS Kubernetes benchmark for clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.20. For more information or help understanding the benchmark, see [Using the benchmark](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cis-benchmark).

## IBM Remediations and Explanations
{: #cis-benchmark-remediations-120}

Review information from IBM on the CIS Benchmark results.
{: shortdesc}


| Section | Remediation/Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| 1.2.1 | IKS utilizes RBAC for cluster protection, but allows anonymous discovery, which is considered reasonable per [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/). |
| 1.2.10 | IKS does not enable the [*EventRateLimit*](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#eventratelimit) admission controller since it is a Kubernetes alpha feature. |
| 1.2.12 | IKS does not enable the [*AlwaysPullImages*](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#alwayspullimages) admission controller since it overrides a container's *imagePullPolicy* and may impact performance. |
| 1.2.21 | IKS enables profiling for cluster administrator troubleshooting purposes. |
| 1.2.22 | IKS can optionally [enable Kubernetes API server auditing](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-audit#audit-api-server). |
| 1.2.23 | IKS can optionally [enable Kubernetes API server auditing](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-audit#audit-api-server). |
| 1.2.24 | IKS can optionally [enable Kubernetes API server auditing](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-audit#audit-api-server). |
| 1.2.25 | IKS can optionally [enable Kubernetes API server auditing](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-audit#audit-api-server). |
| 1.2.33 | IKS can optionally [enable a Kubernetes Key Management Service (KMS) provider](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#kms). |
| 1.2.34 | IKS can optionally [enable a Kubernetes Key Management Service (KMS) provider](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#kms). |
| 1.3.6 | IKS rotates certificates on every worker node reload or update. |
| 3.2.1 | IKS can optionally [enable Kubernetes API server auditing](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-audit#audit-api-server). |
| 3.2.2 | IKS can optionally [enable Kubernetes API server auditing](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-audit#audit-api-server). |
| 4.2.6 | IKS does not protect kernel defaults in order to allow customers to [tune kernel parameters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kernel). |
| 4.2.8 | IKS ensures that the hostname matches the name issued by the infrastructure. |
| 4.2.11 | IKS rotates certificates on every worker node reload or update. |
| 4.2.12 | IKS rotates certificates on every worker node reload or update. |
| 5.1.2 | IKS deploys some system components (for example, Operator Lifecycle Manager) that could have their Kubernetes secret access further restricted. |
| 5.1.3 | IKS deploys some system components (for example Operator Lifecycle Manager) that could have their Kubernetes resource access further restricted. |
| 5.1.5 | IKS does not set *automountServiceAccountToken: false* for each default service account. |
| 5.1.6 | IKS deploys some system components that could set *automountServiceAccountToken: false*.  |
| 5.2.1 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.2 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.3 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.4 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.5 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.6 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.7 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.8 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.2.9 | IKS can optionally [configure pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp). |
| 5.3.2 | IKS has a set of [default Calico and Kubernetes network policies defined](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies#default_policy) and [additional network policies can optionally be added](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies#adding_network_policies).  |
| 5.4.2 | IKS can optionally [enable a Kubernetes Key Management Service (KMS) provider](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption#kms). |
| 5.5.1 | IKS can optionally [enable enforcing image security](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-security_enforce_portieris). |
| 5.6.2 | IKS does not annotate all pods with [seccomp profiles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#seccomp){: external}. |
| 5.6.3 | IKS deploys some system components that do not set a pod or container *securityContext*. |
| 5.6.4 | IKS deploys some Kubernetes resources to the default names. |
