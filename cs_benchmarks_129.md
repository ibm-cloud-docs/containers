# Kubernetes version 1.29 CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
{: #cis-benchmark-129}

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) publishes the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/){: external} as a framework of specific steps to configure Kubernetes more securely and with standards that are commensurate to various industry regulations. This document contains the results of the version 1.5 CIS Kubernetes benchmark for clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.29. For more information or help understanding the benchmark, see [Using the benchmark](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cis-benchmark#cis-benchmark-use).
{: shortdesc}



This version is deprecated. Update your cluster to a [supported version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions) as soon as possible.

| 1.2.1 | {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} utilizes RBAC for cluster protection, but allows anonymous discovery, which is considered reasonable per [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/){: external}. |
| 1.2.10 | {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} does not enable the [`EventRateLimit`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#eventratelimit){: external} admission controller since it is a Kubernetes alpha feature. |

| 1.2.13 | {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} can optionally configure [pod security admission](/docs/containers?topic=containers-pod-security-admission), which is similar to the unsupported [Kubernetes pod security policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/){: external}. |
