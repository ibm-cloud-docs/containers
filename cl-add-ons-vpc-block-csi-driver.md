- Adds the following parameters for customizing the driver.
    - `AttachDetachMinRetryGAP: "3"`: The initial retry interval for checking Attach/Detach Status. The default is 3 seconds.
    - `AttachDetachMinRetryAttempt: "3"`: The number of attempts for AttachDetachMinRetryGAP. The default is 3 retries for 3 seconds retry gap.
    - `AttachDetachMaxRetryAttempt: "46"`: Total number of retries for checking Attach/Detach Status. Default is 46 times. For example,  ~7 minutes (3 secs * 3 times + 6 secs * 6 times + 10 secs * 10 times).
    - `AttacherWorkerThreads: "15"`: The number of `goroutines` for processing VolumeAttachments.
    - `AttacherKubeAPIBurst: "10"`: The number of requests to the Kubernetes API server, exceeding the QPS, that can be sent at any given time
    - `AttacherKubeAPIQPS: "5.0"`: The number of requests per second sent by a Kubernetes client to the Kubernetes API server.
- Disables the `handle-volume-inuse-error` option as this is applies to CSI drivers that support offline expansion only.
