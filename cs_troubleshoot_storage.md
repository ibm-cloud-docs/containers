# Troubleshooting persistent storage
{: #cs_troubleshoot_storage}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for troubleshooting persistent storage.
{: shortdesc}

If you have a more general issue, try out [cluster debugging](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot).
{: tip}

## Debugging persistent storage failures
{: #debug_storage}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

Review the options to debug persistent storage and find the root causes for failures.
{: shortdesc}

1. Verify that you use the latest {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} plug-in version.
   ```
   ibmcloud update
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```
   ibmcloud plugin repo-plugins
   ```
   {: pre}


2. Verify that the `kubectl` CLI version that you run on your local machine matches the Kubernetes version that is installed in your cluster. If you use a `kubectl` CLI version that does not match at least the major.minor version of your cluster, you might experience unexpected results. For example, [Kubernetes does not support ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg “External link icon”)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/) `kubectl` client versions that are 2 or more versions apart from the server version (n +/- 2).
   1. Show the `kubectl` CLI version that is installed in your cluster and your local machine.
      ```
      kubectl version
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.5", GitCommit:"641856db18352033a0d96dbc99153fa3b27298e5", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-03-25T15:53:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.1", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
      Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.5+IKS", GitCommit:"e15454c2216a73b59e9a059fd2def4e6712a7cf0", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-04-01T10:08:07Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
      ```
      {: screen}

      The CLI versions match if you can see the same version in `GitVersion` for the client and the server. You can ignore the `+IKS` part of the version for the server.
   2. If the `kubectl` CLI versions on your local machine and your cluster do not match, either [update your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update) or [install a different CLI version on your local machine](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#kubectl).

3. For block storage, object storage, and Portworx only: Make sure that you [installed the Helm server Tiller with a Kubernetes services account](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#public_helm_install).

4. For classic block storage, object storage, and Portworx only: Make sure that you installed the latest Helm chart version for the plug-in.

   **Block and object storage**:

   1. Update your Helm chart repositories.
      ```
      helm repo update
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. List the Helm charts in the repository.
      **For classic block storage**:
        ```
        helm search iks-charts | grep block-storage-plugin
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        iks-charts-stage/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin	1.5.0        	                                        	A Helm chart for installing ibmcloud block storage plugin   
        iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin      	1.5.0        	                                        	A Helm chart for installing ibmcloud block storage plugin   
        ```
        {: screen}

      **For object storage**:
        ```
        helm search ibm-charts | grep object-storage-plugin
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output:
        ```
        ibm-charts/ibm-object-storage-plugin         	1.0.9        	1.0.9                         	A Helm chart for installing ibmcloud object storage plugin  
        ```
        {: screen}

   3. List the installed Helm charts in your cluster and compare the version that you installed with the version that is available.
      ```
      helm list
      ```
      {: pre}

   4. If a more recent version is available, install this version. For instructions, see [Updating the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#updating-the-ibm-cloud-block-storage-plug-in) and [Updating the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#update_cos_plugin).

   **Portworx**:

   1. Find the [latest Helm chart version](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/community/portworx){: external} that is available.

   2. List the installed Helm charts in your cluster and compare the version that you installed with the version that is available.
      ```
      helm list
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. If a more recent version is available, install this version. For instructions, see [Updating Portworx in your cluster](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx#update_portworx).

5. Verify that the storage driver and plug-in pods show a status of **Running**.
   1. List the pods in the `kube-system` namespace.
      ```
      kubectl get pods -n kube-system
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. If the pods do not show a **Running** status, get more details of the pod to find the root cause. Depending on the status of your pod, you might not be able to execute all of the following commands.
      ```
      kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n kube-system
      ```
      {: pre}

      ```
      kubectl logs <pod_name> -n kube-system
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Analyze the **Events** section of the CLI output of the `kubectl describe pod` command and the latest logs to find the root cause for the error.

6. Check whether your PVC is successfully provisioned.
   1. Check the state of your PVC. A PVC is successfully provisioned if the PVC shows a status of **Bound**.
      ```
      kubectl get pvc
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. If the state of the PVC shows **Pending**, retrieve the error for why the PVC remains pending.
      ```
      kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Review common errors that can occur during the PVC creation.
      - [File storage and classic block storage: PVC remains in a pending state](#file_pvc_pending)
      - [Object storage: PVC remains in a pending state](#cos_pvc_pending)

7. Check whether the pod that mounts your storage instance is successfully deployed.
   1. List the pods in your cluster. A pod is successfully deployed if the pod shows a status of **Running**.
      ```
      kubectl get pods
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Get the details of your pod and check whether errors are displayed in the **Events** section of your CLI output.
      ```
      kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Retrieve the logs for your app and check whether you can see any error messages.
      ```
      kubectl logs <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

   4. Review common errors that can occur when you mount a PVC to your app.
      - [File storage: App cannot access or write to PVC](#file_app_failures)
      - [Classic Block storage: App cannot access or write to PVC](#block_app_failures)
      - [Object storage: Accessing files with a non-root user fails](#cos_nonroot_access)


## File storage and block storage: PVC remains in a pending state
{: #file_pvc_pending}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create a PVC and you run `kubectl get pvc <pvc_name>`, your PVC remains in a **Pending** state, even after waiting for some time.

{: tsCauses}
During the PVC creation and binding, many different tasks are executed by the file and block storage plug-in. Each task can fail and cause a different error message.

{: tsResolve}

1. Find the root cause for why the PVC remains in a **Pending** state.
   ```
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name> -n <namespace>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Review common error message descriptions and resolutions.

### File storage: File systems for worker nodes change to read-only
{: #readonly_nodes}

{: tsSymptoms}
{: #stuck_creating_state}
You might see one of the following symptoms:
- When you run `kubectl get pods -o wide`, you see that multiple pods that are running on the same worker node are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state.
- When you run a `kubectl describe` command, you see the following error in the **Events** section: `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume ... read-only file system`.

{: tsCauses}
The file system on the worker node is read-only.

{: tsResolve}
1.  Back up any data that might be stored on the worker node or in your containers.
2.  For a short-term fix to the existing worker node, reload the worker node.
    <pre class="pre"><code>ibmcloud ks worker reload --cluster &lt;cluster_name&gt; --worker &lt;worker_ID&gt;</code></pre>

For a long-term fix, [update the flavor of your worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#machine_type).

<br />



### File storage: App fails when a non-root user owns the NFS file storage mount path
{: #nonroot}

{: tsSymptoms}
After you [add NFS storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage#file_app_volume_mount) to your deployment, the deployment of your container fails. When you retrieve the logs for your container, you might see errors such as the following. The pod fails and is stuck in a reload cycle.

```
write-permission
```
{: screen}

```
do not have required permission
```
{: screen}

```
cannot create directory '/bitnami/mariadb/data': Permission denied
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
By default, non-root users do not have write permission on the volume mount path for NFS-backed storage. Some common app images, such as Jenkins and Nexus3, specify a non-root user that owns the mount path in the Dockerfile. When you create a container from this Dockerfile, the creation of the container fails due to insufficient permissions of the non-root user on the mount path. To grant write permission, you can modify the Dockerfile to temporarily add the non-root user to the root user group before it changes the mount path permissions, or use an init container.

If you use a Helm chart to deploy the image, edit the Helm deployment to use an init container.
{:tip}



{: tsResolve}
When you include an [init container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/){: external} in your deployment, you can give a non-root user that is specified in your Dockerfile write permissions for the volume mount path inside the container. The init container starts before your app container starts. The init container creates the volume mount path inside the container, changes the mount path to be owned by the correct (non-root) user, and closes. Then, your app container starts with the non-root user that must write to the mount path. Because the path is already owned by the non-root user, writing to the mount path is successful. If you do not want to use an init container, you can modify the Dockerfile to add non-root user access to NFS file storage.


**Before you begin**: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1.  Open the Dockerfile for your app and get the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) from the user that you want to give writer permission on the volume mount path. In the example from a Jenkins Dockerfile, the information is:
    - UID: `1000`
    - GID: `1000`

    **Example**:

    ```
    FROM openjdk:8-jdk

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    ARG user=jenkins
    ARG group=jenkins
    ARG uid=1000
    ARG gid=1000
    ARG http_port=8080
    ARG agent_port=50000

    ENV JENKINS_HOME /var/jenkins_home
    ENV JENKINS_SLAVE_AGENT_PORT ${agent_port}
    ...
    ```
    {:screen}

2.  Add persistent storage to your app by creating a persistent volume claim (PVC). This example uses the `ibmc-file-bronze` storage class. To review available storage classes, run `kubectl get storageclasses`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: mypvc
      annotations:
        volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-bronze"
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 20Gi
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3.  Create the PVC.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f mypvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  In your deployment `.yaml` file, add the init container. Include the UID and GID that you previously retrieved.

    ```yaml
    initContainers:
    - name: initcontainer # Or replace the name
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
      args:
        - chown <UID>:<GID> /mount; # Replace UID and GID with values from the Dockerfile
      volumeMounts:
      - name: volume # Or you can replace with any name
        mountPath: /mount # Must match the mount path in the args line
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    **Example** for a Jenkins deployment:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my_pod
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: jenkins      
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: jenkins
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: jenkins
            image: jenkins
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/jenkins_home
              name: volume
          volumes:
          - name: volume
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: mypvc
          initContainers:
          - name: permissionsfix
            image: alpine:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
            args:
              - chown 1000:1000 /mount;
            volumeMounts:
            - name: volume
              mountPath: /mount
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5.  Create the pod and mount the PVC to your pod.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f my_pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Verify that the volume is successfully mounted to your pod. Note the pod name and **Containers/Mounts** path.
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <my_pod>
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Example output**:
   ```
   Name:       mypod-123456789
   Namespace:	default
   ...
   Init Containers:
   ...
   Mounts:
     /mount from volume (rw)
     /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-cp9f0 (ro)
   ...
   Containers:
     jenkins:
       Container ID:
       Image:		jenkins
       Image ID:
       Port:		  <none>
       State:		Waiting
         Reason:		PodInitializing
       Ready:		False
       Restart Count:	0
       Environment:	<none>
       Mounts:
         /var/jenkins_home from volume (rw)
         /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-cp9f0 (ro)
   ...
   Volumes:
     myvol:
       Type:	PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
       ClaimName:	mypvc
       ReadOnly:	  false

   ```
   {: screen}

7.  Log in to the pod by using the pod name that you previously noted.
    ```
    kubectl exec -it <my_pod-123456789> /bin/bash
    ```
    {: pre}

8. Verify the permissions of your container's mount path. In the example, the mount path is `/var/jenkins_home`.
   ```
   ls -ln /var/jenkins_home
   ```
   {: pre}

   **Example output**:
   ```
   jenkins@mypod-123456789:/$ ls -ln /var/jenkins_home
   total 12
   -rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000  102 Mar  9 19:58 copy_reference_file.log
   drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Mar  9 19:58 init.groovy.d
   drwxr-xr-x 9 1000 1000 4096 Mar  9 20:16 war
   ```
   {: screen}

   This output shows that the GID and UID from your Dockerfile (in this example, `1000` and `1000`) own the mount path inside the container.

### File storage: Adding non-root user access to persistent storage fails
{: #cs_storage_nonroot}

{: tsSymptoms}
After you [add non-root user access to persistent storage](#nonroot) or deploy a Helm chart with a non-root user ID specified, the user cannot write to the mounted storage.

{: tsCauses}
Your app deployment or Helm chart configuration specifies the [security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) for the pod's `fsGroup` (group ID) and `runAsUser` (user ID). Generally, a pod's default security context sets [`runAsNonRoot`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups) so that the pod cannot run as the root user. Because the `fsGroup` setting is not designed for shared storage such as NFS file storage, the `fsGroup` setting is not supported, and the `runAsUser` setting is automatically set to `2020`. These default settings do not allow other non-root users to write to the mounted storage.

{: tsResolve}
To allow a non-root user read and write access to a file storage device, you must allocate a [supplemental group ID](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups){: external} in a storage class, refer to this storage class in the PVC, and set the pod's security context with a `runAsUser` value that is automatically added to the supplemental group ID. When you grant the supplemental group ID read and write access to the file storage, any non-root user that belongs to the group ID, including your pod, is granted access to the file storage.

Allocating a supplemental group ID for a non-root user of a file storage device is supported for single zone clusters only, and cannot be used in multizone clusters.
{: note}

1. Create a YAML file for your customized storage class that defines the supplemental group ID that you want to use to provide read and write access to the file storage for your non-root user. To decide on the configuration for your storage class, review [Deciding on the block storage configuration](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#block_predefined_storageclass). In your storage class YAML file, include the `gidAllocate: "true"` parameter to assign the default group ID `65531` to your non-root user. If you want to assign a different group ID, you must specify the `gidFixed` parameter in addition to the `gidAllocate` parameter.

   **Example for using the default group ID `65531`**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
      name: ibmc-file-bronze-gid
      labels:
        kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
   provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-file
   parameters:
      type: "Endurance"
      iopsPerGB: "2"
      sizeRange: "[1-12000]Gi"
      mountOptions: nfsvers=4.1,hard
      billingType: "hourly"
      reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
      classVersion: "2"
      gidAllocate: "true"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   **Example to specify a different group ID**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: ibmc-file-bronze-gid-fixed
     labels:
       kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
   provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-file
   parameters:
     type: "Endurance"
     iopsPerGB: "2"
     sizeRange: "[1-12000]Gi"
     mountOptions: nfsvers=4.1,hard
     billingType: "hourly"
     reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
     classVersion: "2"
     gidAllocate: "true"
     gidFixed: "65165"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Create the storage class in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Create a YAML file for your PVC that uses the storage class that you created.

   ```yaml
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
   name: gid-pvc
   labels:
     billingType: "monthly"
   spec:
   accessModes:
     - ReadWriteMany
   resources:
     requests:
       storage: 20Gi
   storageClassName: ibmc-file-bronze-gid
   ```
   {: codeblock}

5. Create the PVC in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

6. Wait a few minutes for the file storage to be provisioned and the PVC to change to a `Bound` status.
   ```
   kubectl get pvc
   ```
   {: pre}

   If you tried creating the PVC in a multizone cluster, the PVC remains in a `pending` state.
   {: note}

   Example output:
   ```
   NAME      STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS           AGE
   gid-pvc   Bound    pvc-5e4acab4-9b6f-4278-b53c-22e1d3ffa123   20Gi       RWX            ibmc-file-bronze-gid   2m54s
   ```
   {: screen}

7. Create a YAML file for your deployment that mounts the PVC that you created. In the `spec.template.spec.securityContext.runAsUser` field, specify the non-root user ID that you want to use. This user ID is automatically added to the supplemental group ID that is defined in the storage class to gain read and write access to the file storage.

   **Example for creating an `node-hello` deployment**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: gid-deployment
     labels:
       app: gid
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: gid
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: gid
       spec:
         containers:
         - image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
           name: gid-container
           volumeMounts:
           - name: gid-vol
             mountPath: /myvol
         securityContext:
           runAsUser: 2020
         volumes:
         - name: gid-vol
           persistentVolumeClaim:
             claimName: gid-pvc
   ```
   {: codeblock}

8. Create the deployment in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

9. Verify that your pod is in a **Running** status.
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   gid-deployment-5dc86db4c4-5hbts   2/2     Running   0          69s
   ```
   {: screen}

10. Log in to your pod.
    ```
    kubectl exec <pod_name> -it bash
    ```
    {: pre}

11. Verify the read and write permissions for the non-root user.
    1. List the user ID and group IDs for the current user inside the pod.
       ```
       id
       ```
       {: pre}

       Example output:
       ```
       uid=2020 gid=0(root) groups=0(root), 65531
       ```
       {: screen}

       The setup is correct if your non-root user ID is listed as `uid` and the supplemental group ID that you defined in your storage class is listed under `groups`.

    2. List the permissions for your volume mount directory that you defined in your deployment.
       ```
       ls -l /<volume_mount_path>
       ```
       {: pre}

       Example output:
       ```
       drwxrwxr-x 2 nobody 65531 4096 Dec 11 07:40 .
       drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root  4096 Dec 11 07:30 ..
       ```
       {: screen}

       The setup is correct if the supplemental group ID that you defined in your storage class is listed with read and write permissions in your volume mount directory.

   3. Create a file in your mount directory.
      ```
      echo "Able to write to file storage with my non-root user." > /myvol/gidtest.txt
      ```
      {: pre}

   4. List the permissions for the files in your volume mount directory.
      ```
      ls -al /mnt/nfsvol/
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      drwxrwxr-x 2 nobody      65531 4096 Dec 11 07:40 .
      drwxr-xr-x 1 root        root  4096 Dec 11 07:30 ..
      -rw-r--r-- 1 2020   4294967294   42 Dec 11 07:40 gidtest.txt .
      ```
      {: screen}

      In your CLI output, the non-root user ID is listed with read and write access to the file that you created.

   5. Exit your pod.
      ```
      exit
      ```
      {: pre}


If you need to change the ownership of the mount path from `nobody`, see [App fails when a non-root user owns the NFS file storage mount path](#nonroot).

## Block Storage: App cannot access or write to PVC
{: #block_app_failures}

When you mount a PVC to your pod, you might experience errors when accessing or writing to the PVC.
{: shortdesc}

1. List the pods in your cluster and review the status of the pod.
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Find the root cause for why your app cannot access or write to the PVC.
   ```
   kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```
   kubectl logs <pod_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Review common errors that can occur when you mount a PVC to a pod.

### Block storage: Block storage changes to read-only
{: #readonly_block}

{: tsSymptoms}
You might see the following symptoms:
- When you run `kubectl get pods -o wide`, you see that multiple pods on the same worker node are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` or `CrashLoopBackOff` state. All these pods use the same block storage instance.
- When you run a `kubectl describe pod` command, you see the following error in the **Events** section: `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume ... read-only`.

{: tsCauses}
If a network error occurs while a pod writes to a volume, IBM Cloud infrastructure protects the data on the volume from getting corrupted by changing the volume to a read-only mode. Pods that use this volume cannot continue to write to the volume and fail.

{: tsResolve}
1. Check the version of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in that is installed in your cluster.
   ```
   helm list
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Verify that you use the [latest version of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/helm/iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin). If not, [update your plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#updating-the-ibm-cloud-block-storage-plug-in).
3. If you used a Kubernetes deployment for your pod, restart the pod that is failing by removing the pod and letting Kubernetes re-create it. If you did not use a deployment, retrieve the YAML file that was used to create your pod by running `kubectl get pod <pod_name> -o yaml >pod.yaml`. Then, delete and manually re-create the pod.
    ```
    kubectl delete pod <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Check whether re-creating your pod resolved the issue. If not, reload the worker node.
   1. Find the worker node where your pod runs and note the private IP address that is assigned to your worker node.
      ```
      kubectl describe pod <pod_name> | grep Node
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      Node:               10.75.XX.XXX/10.75.XX.XXX
      Node-Selectors:  <none>
      ```
      {: screen}

   2. Retrieve the **ID** of your worker node by using the private IP address from the previous step.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Gracefully [reload the worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload).

### Block storage: Mounting existing block storage to a pod fails due to the wrong file system
{: #block_filesystem}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you run `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>`, you see the following error:
```
failed to mount the volume as "ext4", it already contains xfs. Mount error: mount failed: exit status 32
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
You have an existing block storage device that is set up with an `XFS` file system. To mount this device to your pod, you [created a PV](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#existing_block) that specified `ext4` as your file system or no file system in the `spec/flexVolume/fsType` section. If no file system is defined, the PV defaults to `ext4`.
The PV was created successfully and was linked to your existing block storage instance. However, when you try to mount the PV to your cluster by using a matching PVC, the volume fails to mount. You cannot mount your `XFS` block storage instance with an `ext4` file system to the pod.

{: tsResolve}
Update the file system in the existing PV from `ext4` to `XFS`.

1. List the existing PVs in your cluster and note the name of the PV that you used for your existing block storage instance.
   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Save the PV YAML on your local machine.
   ```
   kubectl get pv <pv_name> -o yaml > <filepath/xfs_pv.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Open the YAML file and change the `fsType` from `ext4` to `xfs`.
4. Replace the PV in your cluster.
   ```
   kubectl replace --force -f <filepath/xfs_pv.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Log in to the pod where you mounted the PV.
   ```
   kubectl exec -it <pod_name> sh
   ```
   {: pre}

6. Verify that the file system changed to `XFS`.
   ```
   df -Th
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   Filesystem Type Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/mapper/3600a098031234546d5d4c9876654e35 xfs 20G 33M 20G 1% /myvolumepath

## Object storage: Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} `ibmc` Helm plug-in fails
{: #cos_helm_fails}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you install the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} `ibmc` Helm plug-in, the installation fails with one of the following errors:
```
Error: symlink /Users/iks-charts/ibm-object-storage-plugin/helm-ibmc /Users/ibm/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc: file exists
```
{: screen}

```
Error: fork/exec /home/iksadmin/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh: permission denied
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
When the `ibmc` Helm plug-in is installed, a symlink is created from the `./helm/plugins/helm-ibmc` directory to the directory where the `ibmc` Helm plug-in is located on your local system, which is usually in `./ibmcloud-object-storage-plugin/helm-ibmc`. When you remove the `ibmc` Helm plug-in from your local system, or you move the `ibmc` Helm plug-in directory to a different location, the symlink is not removed.

If you see a `permission denied` error, you do not have the required `read`, `write`, and `execute` permission on the `ibmc.sh` bash file so that you can execute `ibmc` Helm plug-in commands.

{: tsResolve}

**For symlink errors**:

1. Remove the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} Helm plug-in.
   ```
   rm -rf ~/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Follow the [documentation](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#install_cos) to re-install the `ibmc` Helm plug-in and the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in.

**For permission errors**:

1. Change the permissions for the `ibmc` plug-in.
   ```
   chmod 755 ~/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Try out the `ibm` Helm plug-in.
   ```
   helm ibmc --help
   ```
   {: pre}

3. [Continue installing the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#install_cos).

## Object storage: PVC remains in a pending state
{: #cos_pvc_pending}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create a PVC and you run `kubectl get pvc <pvc_name>`, your PVC remains in a **Pending** state, even after waiting for some time.

{: tsCauses}
During the PVC creation and binding, many different tasks are executed by the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in. Each task can fail and cause a different error message.

{: tsResolve}

1. Find the root cause for why the PVC remains in a **Pending** state.
   ```
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name> -n <namespace>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Review common error message descriptions and resolutions.

### Object storage: PVC or pod creation fails due to not finding the Kubernetes secret
{: #cos_secret_access_fails}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create your PVC or deploy a pod that mounts the PVC, the creation or deployment fails.

- Example error message for a PVC creation failure:
  ```
  cannot get credentials: cannot get secret tsecret-key: secrets "secret-key" not found
  ```
  {: screen}

- Example error message for a pod creation failure:
  ```
  persistentvolumeclaim "pvc-3" not found (repeated 3 times)
  ```
  {: screen}

{: tsCauses}
The Kubernetes secret where you store your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service credentials, the PVC, and the pod are not all in the same Kubernetes namespace. When the secret is deployed to a different namespace than your PVC or pod, the secret cannot be accessed.

{: tsResolve}
This task requires [**Writer** or **Manager** {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM service role](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#platform) for all namespaces.

1. List the secrets in your cluster and review the Kubernetes namespace where the Kubernetes secret for your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance is created. The secret must show `ibm/ibmc-s3fs` as the **Type**.
   ```
   kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Check your YAML configuration file for your PVC and pod to verify that you used the same namespace. If you want to deploy a pod in a different namespace than the one where your secret exists, [create another secret](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#create_cos_secret) in that namespace.

3. Create the PVC or deploy the pod in the appropriate namespace.

<br />


### Object storage: PVC creation fails due to wrong credentials or access denied
{: #cred_failure}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create the PVC, you see an error message similar to one of the following:

```
SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. For more information, see REST Authentication and SOAP Authentication for details.
```
{: screen}

```
AccessDenied: Access Denied status code: 403

{: screen}

```
InvalidAccessKeyId: The AWS Access Key ID you provided does not exist in our records`
```
{: screen}

```
cannot access bucket <bucket_name>: Forbidden: Forbidden
```
{: screen}


{: tsCauses}
The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service credentials that you use to access the service instance might be wrong, or allow only read access to your bucket.

{: tsResolve}
1. In the navigation on the service details page, click **Service Credentials**.
2. Find your credentials, then click **View credentials**.
3. In the **iam_role_crn** section, verify that you have the `Writer` or `Manager` role. If you do not have the correct role, you must create new {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service credentials with the correct permission.
4. If the role is correct, verify that you use the correct **access_key_id** and **secret_access_key** in your Kubernetes secret.
5. [Create a new secret with the updated **access_key_id** and **secret_access_key**](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#create_cos_secret).

### Object storage: PVC creation fails due to wrong s3fs or IAM API endpoint
{: #cos_api_endpoint_failure}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create the PVC, the PVC remains in a pending state. After you run the `kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name>` command, you see one of the following error messages:

```
Bad value for ibm.io/object-store-endpoint XXXX: scheme is missing. Must be of the form http://<hostname> or https://<hostname>
```
{: screen}

```
Bad value for ibm.io/iam-endpoint XXXX: scheme is missing. Must be of the form http://<hostname> or https://<hostname>
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
The s3fs API endpoint for the bucket that you want to use might have the wrong format, or your cluster is deployed in a location that is supported in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} but is not yet supported by the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in.

{: tsResolve}
1. Check the s3fs API endpoint that was automatically assigned by the `ibmc` Helm plug-in to your storage classes during the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in installation. The endpoint is based on the location that your cluster is deployed to.  
   ```
   kubectl get sc ibmc-s3fs-standard-regional -o yaml | grep object-store-endpoint
   ```
   {: pre}

   If the command returns `ibm.io/object-store-endpoint: NA`, your cluster is deployed in a location that is supported in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} but is not yet supported by the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in. To add the location to the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, post a question in our public Slack or open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} support case. For more information, see [Getting help and support](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot#ts_getting_help).

2. If you manually added the s3fs API endpoint with the `ibm.io/endpoint` annotation or the IAM API endpoint with the `ibm.io/iam-endpoint` annotation in your PVC, make sure that you added the endpoints in the format `https://<s3fs_api_endpoint>` and `https://<iam_api_endpoint>`. The annotation overwrites the API endpoints that are automatically set by the `ibmc` plug-in in the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} storage classes.
   ```
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

<br />


### Object storage: Cannot access an existing bucket
{: #cos_access_bucket_fails}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create the PVC, the bucket in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} cannot be accessed. You see an error message similar to the following:

```
Failed to provision volume with StorageClass "ibmc-s3fs-standard-regional": pvc:1b2345678b69175abc98y873e2:cannot access bucket <bucket_name>: NotFound: Not Found
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
You might have used the wrong storage class to access your existing bucket, or you tried to access a bucket that you did not create. You cannot access a bucket that you did not create.

{: tsResolve}
1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}, select your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance.
2. Select **Buckets**.
3. Review the **Class** and **Location** information for your existing bucket.
4. Choose the appropriate [storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage#cos_storageclass_reference).
5. Make sure that you set `ibm.io/auto-create-bucket: false` and that you provide the correct name of your existing bucket.

<br />


## Object storage: Changing the ownership of the mount path fails
{: #cos_mountpath_error}

{: tsSymptoms}
You created a deployment that mounts an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket to your app. During the deployment, you try to change the ownership of the volume mount path, but this action fails. You see error messages similar to the following:

```
chown: changing ownership of '<volume_mount_path>': Input/output error
chown: changing ownership of '<volume_mount_path>': Operation not permitted
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
When you create a bucket in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, the bucket is managed by `s3fs-fuse`. The UID and GID that own the volume mount path are automatically set by Fuse when you mount the bucket to your app and cannot be changed.

{: tsResolve}
You cannot change the ownership of the volume mount path. However, you can change the UID and GID for a file or a directory that is stored under your volume mount path. For more information, see [Object storage: Accessing files with a non-root user fails](#cos_nonroot_access).


## Object storage: Accessing files with a non-root user fails
{: #cos_nonroot_access}

{: tsSymptoms}
You uploaded files to your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance by using the console or the REST API. When you try to access these files with a non-root user that you defined with `runAsUser` in your app deployment, access to the files is denied.

{: tsCauses}
In Linux, a file or a directory has three access groups: `Owner`, `Group`, and `Other`. When you upload a file to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} by using the console or the REST API, the permissions for the `Owner`, `Group`, and `Other` are removed. The permission of each file looks as follows:

```
d--------- 1 root root 0 Jan 1 1970 <file_name>
```
{: screen}

When you upload a file by using the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in, the permissions for the file are preserved and not changed.

{: tsResolve}
To access the file with a non-root user, the non-root user must have read and write permissions for the file. Changing the permission on a file as part of your pod deployment requires a write operation. {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} is not designed for write workloads. Updating permissions during the pod deployment might prevent your pod from getting into a `Running` state.

To resolve this issue, before you mount the PVC to your app pod, create another pod to set the correct permission for the non-root user.

1. Check the permissions of your files in your bucket.
   1. Create a configuration file for your `test-permission` pod and name the file `test-permission.yaml`.
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: test-permission
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: test-permission
          image: nginx
          volumeMounts:
          - name: cos-vol
            mountPath: /test
        volumes:
        - name: cos-vol
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: <pvc_name>
      ```
      {: codeblock}

   2. Create the `test-permission` pod.
      ```
      kubectl apply -f test-permission.yaml
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Log in to your pod.
      ```
      kubectl exec test-permission -it bash
      ```
      {: pre}

   4. Navigate to your mount path and list the permissions for your files.
      ```
      cd test && ls -al
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      d--------- 1 root root 0 Jan 1 1970 <file_name>
      ```
      {: screen}

2. Delete the pod.
   ```
   kubectl delete pod test-permission
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Create a configuration file for the pod that you use to correct the permissions of your files and name it `fix-permission.yaml`.
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: fix-permission
     namespace: <namespace>
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: fix-permission
       image: busybox
       command: ['sh', '-c']
       args: ['chown -R <nonroot_userID> <mount_path>/*; find <mount_path>/ -type d -print -exec chmod u=+rwx,g=+rx {} \;']
       volumeMounts:
       - mountPath: "<mount_path>"
         name: cos-volume
     volumes:
     - name: cos-volume
       persistentVolumeClaim:
         claimName: <pvc_name>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. Create the `fix-permission` pod.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f fix-permission.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Wait for the pod to go into a `Completed` state.  
   ```
   kubectl get pod fix-permission
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Delete the `fix-permission` pod.
   ```
   kubectl delete pod fix-permission
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Re-create the `test-permission` pod that you used earlier to check the permissions.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f test-permission.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Verify that the permissions for your files are updated.
   1. Log in to your pod.
      ```
      kubectl exec test-permission -it bash
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Navigate to your mount path and list the permissions for your files.
      ```
      cd test && ls -al
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      -rwxrwx--- 1 <nonroot_userID> root 6193 Aug 21 17:06 <file_name>
      ```
      {: screen}

6. Delete the `test-permission` pod.
   ```
   kubectl delete pod test-permission
   ```
   {: pre}

7. Mount the PVC to the app with the non-root user.

   Define the non-root user as `runAsUser` without setting `fsGroup` in your deployment YAML at the same time. Setting `fsGroup` triggers the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in to update the group permissions for all files in a bucket when the pod is deployed. Updating the permissions is a write operation and might prevent your pod from getting into a `Running` state.
   {: important}

After you set the correct file permissions in your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance, do not upload files by using the console or the REST API. Use the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in to add files to your service instance.

## PVC creation fails because of missing permissions
{: #missing_permissions}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create a PVC, the PVC remains pending. When you run `kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name>`, you see an error message similar to the following:

```
User doesn't have permissions to create or manage Storage
```
{: screen}

{: tsCauses}
The IAM API key or the IBM Cloud infrastructure API key that is stored in the `storage-secret-store` Kubernetes secret of your cluster  does not have all the required permissions to provision persistent storage.

{: tsResolve}
1. Retrieve the IAM key or IBM Cloud infrastructure API key that is stored in the `storage-secret-store` Kubernetes secret of your cluster and verify that the correct API key is used.
   ```
   kubectl get secret storage-secret-store -n kube-system -o yaml | grep slclient.toml: | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   [Bluemix]
   iam_url = "https://iam.bluemix.net"
   iam_client_id = "bx"
   iam_client_secret = "bx"
   iam_api_key = "<iam_api_key>"
   refresh_token = ""
   pay_tier = "paid"
   containers_api_route = "https://us-south.containers.bluemix.net"

   [Softlayer]
   encryption = true
   softlayer_username = ""
   softlayer_api_key = ""
   softlayer_endpoint_url = "https://api.softlayer.com/rest/v3"
   softlayer_iam_endpoint_url = "https://api.softlayer.com/mobile/v3"
   softlayer_datacenter = "dal10"
   ```
   {: screen}

   The IAM API key is listed in the `Bluemix.iam_api_key` section of your CLI output. If the `Softlayer.softlayer_api_key` is empty at the same time, then the IAM API key is used to determine your infrastructure permissions. The IAM API key is automatically set by the user who runs the first action that requires the IAM **Administrator** platform role in a resource group and region. If a different API key is set in `Softlayer.softlayer_api_key`, then this key takes precedence over the IAM API key. The `Softlayer.softlayer_api_key` is set when a cluster admin runs the `ibmcloud ks credentials-set` command.

2. If you want to change the credentials, update the API key that is used.
    1.  To update the IAM API key, use the `ibmcloud ks api-key reset` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_api_key_reset). To update the IBM Cloud infrastructure key, use the `ibmcloud ks credential set` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_credentials_set).
    2. Wait about 10 - 15 minutes for the `storage-secret-store` Kubernetes secret to update, then verify that the key is updated.
       ```
       kubectl get secret storage-secret-store -n kube-system -o yaml | grep slclient.toml: | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode
       ```
       {: pre}

3. If the API key is correct, verify that the key has the correct permission to provision persistent storage.
   1. Contact the account owner to verify the permission of the API key.
   2. As the account owner, select **Manage** > **Access (IAM)** from the navigation in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
   3. Select **Users** and find the user whose API key you want to use.
   4. From the actions menu, select **Manage user details**.
   5. Go to the **Classic infrastructure** tab.
   6. Expand the **Account** category and verify that the **Add/ Upgrade Storage (Storage Layer)** permission is assigned.
   7. Expand the **Services** category and verify that the **Storage Manage** permission is assigned.
4. Remove the PVC that failed.
   ```
   kubectl delete pvc <pvc_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Re-create the PVC.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
   ```

## Portworx: Debugging your Portworx installation
{: #debug-portworx}

{: tsSymptoms}
When you create a Portworx service instance from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, the Portworx installation in your cluster fails and the service instance shows a status of **Provision failure**.

{: tsCauses}
Before Portworx is installed in your cluster, a number of checks are performed to verify the information that you provided on the Portworx service page of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. If one of these checks fails, the status of the Portworx service is changed to **Provision failure**. You cannot see the details of what check failed or what information is missing to complete the installation.

{: tsResolve}
Follow this guide to start troubleshooting your Portworx installation and to verify the information that you entered in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. If you find information that you entered incorrectly or you must change the setup of your cluster, correct the information or the cluster setup. Then, create a new Portworx service instance to restart the installation.

### Step 1: Verifying the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog information
{: #px-verify-catalog}

Start by verifying that the information that you entered in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog is correct. If information was entered incorrectly, the installation does not pass the pre-installation checks and fails without starting the installation.
{: shortdesc}

1. Verify that the cluster where you want to install Portworx is located in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region and resource group that you selected.
   ```
   ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```
   {: pre}
2. Verify that the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key that you entered has sufficient permissions to work with your cluster. You must be assigned the **Editor** platform role and the **Manager** service access role for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. For more information, see [User access permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference).
3. Verify that you entered the `etcd` API endpoint for your Databases for etcd service instance in the correct format.  
   1. [Retrieve the Databases for etcd endpoint](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx#databases_credentials).
   2. Add the etcd endpoint in the format `etcd:<etcd_endpoint1>;etcd:<etcd_endpoint2>`. If you have more than one endpoint, include all endpoints and separate them with a semicolon (;).

      Example endpoint:
      ```
      etcd:https://1ab234c5-12a1-1234-a123.databases.appdomain.cloud:32059
      ```
      {: screen}
4. Verify that you stored the credentials to access your Databases for etcd service instance in a Kubernetes secret in your cluster. For more information, see [Setting up a Databases for etcd service instance for Portworx metadata](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx#portworx_database).
   1. Review steps 4-6 and verify that you retrieved the correct username, password, and certificate.
   2. List the secrets in your cluster and look for the secret that holds the credentials of your Databases for etcd service instance.
      ```
      kubectl get secrets
      ```
      {: pre}
   3. Make sure that the username, password, and certificate are stored as a base64 encoded value in your Kubernetes secret.
   4. Verify that you entered the correct name of the secret in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.
5. If you chose to set up volume encryption with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}}, make sure that you created an instance of {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and that you stored the credentials to access your instance in a Kubernetes secret in the `portworx` namespace of your cluster. For more information, see [Enabling per-volume encryption for your Portworx volumes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx#setup_encryption).
   1. Make sure that the API key of your service ID, and the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} instance ID, root key, and API endpoint are stored as base64 values in the Kubernetes secret of your cluster.
   2. Make sure that you named your secret `px-ibm`.
   3. Make sure that you created the secret in the `portworx` namespace of your cluster.

### Step 2: Verifying the cluster setup
{: #px-verify-cluster}

If you entered the correct information on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog page, verify that your cluster is correctly set up for Portworx.
{: shortdesc}

1. Verify that you selected a classic {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} cluster. VPC on Classic clusters are not supported in Portworx.
2. Verify that the cluster that you want to use meets the [minimum hardware requirements for Portworx](https://docs.portworx.com/start-here-installation/){: external}.
3. If you want to use a virtual machine cluster, make sure that you [added raw, unformatted, and unmounted block storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-portworx#create_block_storage) to your cluster so that Portworx can include the disks into the Portworx storage layer.
4. Verify that your cluster is set up with public network connectivity. For more information, see [Understanding network basics of classic clusters](/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#plan_basics).
5. Verify that Helm version 2.14.3 or higher is correctly installed in your cluster. For more information, see [Setting up Helm in a cluster with public access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#public_helm_install).
