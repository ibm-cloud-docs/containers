# {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} events
{: #at_events}

You can view, manage, and audit user-initated activities in your {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} cluster by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} service.
{: shortdesc}

## Finding the information
{: #at-find}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} events are available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} **account domain** that is available in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region where the events are generated. {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} events are available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} **space domain** that is associated to the Cloud Foundry space where the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} service is provisioned.

To monitor administrative activity:

1. Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.
2. From the catalog, provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} service in the same account as your instance of  {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}.
3. On the **Manage** tab of the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} dashboard, click the **View in Kibana**.
4. Set the time frame that you want to view logs for. The default is 15 min.
5. In the **Available Fields** list, click **type**. Click the magnifying glass icon for **Activity Tracker** to limit the logs to only those tracked by the service.
6. You can use the other available fields to narrow your search.
