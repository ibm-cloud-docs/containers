# VPC clusters: Security group protocol error creating or updating a LoadBalancer
{: #vpc_ts_lb_security_group_error}
{: support}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc}

Creating or updating a `LoadBalancer` service in your VPC cluster fails with cluster event similar to the following.
{: tsSymptoms}


```txt
error unmarshalling property 'security_groups' as []vpcv1.SecurityGroup: error unmarshalling property 'rules' as []vpcv1.SecurityGroupRuleIntf: unrecognized value for discriminator property 'protocol':
```
{: screen}

You can review cluster events by running the following commands.
```sh
kubectl get events -A | grep protocol
```
{: pre}

```sh
kubectl describe svc -A
```
{: pre}


These errors, as well as related problems with Ingress and Load Balancers, are caused by adding a security group to your VPC that uses one of the newly introduced protocol options, including the new **Any** protocol option.
{: tsCauses}

Until IBM provides a permanent fix, remove any security group rules that you added that use the new protocol options, or change the protocol of these rules to one of `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, or the combined `tcp-udp-icmp` protocol option.
