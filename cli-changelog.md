- With the release of the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} version 2 API](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_api_install#api_about), the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI `kubernetes-service` plug-in supports both classic and VPC infrastructure providers.

- Adds the `--pod-subnet` and `--service-subnet` options to the `ibmcloud ks cluster create classic` commands for standard clusters that run Kubernetes 1.15 or later. If you plan to connect your cluster to on-premises networks, you can avoid subnet conflicts by specifying a custom subnet CIDR that provides the private IP addresses for your pods and subnets. 
- Enhances the `ibmcloud ks nlb-dns create` and `ibmcloud ks nlb-dns add` commands so that you can add more than one IP address at a time. For example, to create a DNS entry for multiple network load balancer IP addresses, use multiple options such as `ibmcloud ks nlb-dns create --cluster mycluster --ip IP1 --ip IP2`.
