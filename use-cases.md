## Financial services
{: #uc-finance}

### Trim IT costs and accelerate regulatory compliance
{: #uc-finance-mortgage}

A residential mortgage company processes 70 million records a day. Their on-premises system was slow, inaccurate, and expensive to maintain. By migrating risk analysis apps to {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}, they containerized workloads across global regions, eliminated hardware refresh cycles, and automated regulatory reporting.

Key results:
- Complex financial simulations complete in 25% of the previous time
- Deployment cycle reduced from 6–9 months to 1–3 weeks
- Regulatory reporting costs reduced through scalable, consistent infrastructure

### Deploy AI-enabled tools 4x faster
{: #uc-finance-payments}

A payment technology company needed to deliver fraud detection and country-specific payment features to partners faster. By moving to {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} with {{site.data.keyword.watson}} AI for Financial Services and {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}, they replaced slow hardware-bound build processes with automated CI/CD pipelines.

Key results:
- Development teams deliver updates 10 times daily
- Fraud detection and prevention improved 4x over regional average
- Exponential transaction scaling without infrastructure investment

## Healthcare
{: #uc-health}

### Migrate patient systems from VMs to containers
{: #uc-health-migrate}

A healthcare organization migrated inefficient virtual machine-based patient systems to containers on {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}, improving operational agility while maintaining strict compliance and availability requirements.

Key results:
- Reduced infrastructure overhead and VM sprawl
- Faster deployment cycles for patient-facing applications
- Maintained compliance with healthcare data regulations

### Securely host sensitive research data
{: #uc-health-research}

A research institution needed to share sensitive patient data securely with external partners. {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} provided isolated, compliant environments with fine-grained access control, enabling collaborative research without compromising data security.

Key results:
- Secure partner access without exposing raw data
- Scalable compute for research workloads
- Audit-ready access controls

## Retail
{: #uc-retail}

### Share data via APIs to drive omnichannel sales
{: #uc-retail-data}

A global retailer built API-driven data sharing across business partners to synchronize inventory, pricing, and promotions across online and physical channels. {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} provided the elastic, always-on platform for high-volume API traffic.

Key results:
- Real-time inventory visibility across channels
- Faster partner onboarding through standardized APIs
- Resilient architecture that handles seasonal traffic spikes

### Optimize inventory with digital insights
{: #uc-retail-grocer}

A grocery chain used {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} with analytics services to correlate sales patterns with inventory data, reducing waste and improving stock availability.

Key results:
- Reduced inventory waste through demand forecasting
- Faster response to regional sales trends
- Lower operational costs from optimized ordering

## Transportation
{: #uc-transport}

### Build and deploy HR sites with AI in under 3 weeks
{: #uc-transport-airline}

An airline built and deployed an AI-powered HR self-service site in under three weeks using {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.watson}}. Containerized microservices replaced a legacy monolith, enabling rapid iteration.

Key results:
- Full deployment in under 3 weeks
- HR self-service reduced support ticket volume
- Continuous delivery pipeline enabled weekly updates

### Increase availability of worldwide partner systems
{: #uc-transport-shipping}

A global shipping company needed near-zero downtime for partner integration systems across multiple regions. {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}'s built-in high availability, multi-zone worker pools, and automated recovery maintained SLA commitments worldwide.

Key results:
- Multi-region deployment with automated failover
- SLA compliance for partner integrations
- Reduced on-call burden through self-healing infrastructure

## Government
{: #uc-gov}

### Secure data exchange between public and private organizations
{: #uc-gov-port}

A government agency needed to exchange sensitive data with private sector partners securely. {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} provided isolated namespaces, network policies, and audit logging to meet public sector compliance requirements.

Key results:
- Compliant, auditable data exchange
- Reduced time to onboard new partner organizations
- Consistent security posture across environments

### Improve collaboration velocity with open data
{: #uc-gov-data}

A government agency combined public and private datasets to accelerate policy analysis. {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} enabled rapid prototyping and deployment of data processing workloads without long infrastructure procurement cycles.

Key results:
- Faster delivery of citizen-facing data services
- Reduced time from data ingestion to analysis
- Reusable container-based pipelines across departments
