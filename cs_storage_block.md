# Storing data on classic IBM Cloud {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}
{: #block_storage}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} is persistent, high-performance iSCSI storage that you can add to your apps by using Kubernetes persistent volumes (PVs). You can choose between predefined storage tiers with GB sizes and IOPS that meet the requirements of your workloads. To find out whether {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} is the right storage option for you, see [Choosing a storage solution](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#choose_storage_solution). For more information about pricing, see [Billing](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-About#billing).
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} is available only for standard {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters that are provisioned on classic infrastructure, and is not supported in VPC clusters. If your cluster cannot access the public network, such as a private cluster behind a firewall or a cluster with only the private service endpoint enabled, make sure that you installed the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plug-in version 1.3.0 or later to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} instance over the private network. {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} instances are specific to a single zone. If you have a multizone cluster, consider [multizone persistent storage options](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).
{: important}

If you installed the {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plugin with Helm version 2, [migrate to Helm version 3](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#migrate_v3).

## Quickstart for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}
{: #block_qs}

In this quickstart guide, you create a 24Gi silver tier {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volume in your cluster by creating a PVC to dynamically provision the volume. Then, you create an app deployment that mounts your PVC.
{: shortdesc}

First time using {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} in your cluster? Come back here after you have the [installed the {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plugin](#install_block).
{: tip}

1. Create a file for your PVC and name it `pvc.yaml`.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: my-pvc
    labels:
      billingType: "hourly"
      region: # Example: us-south
      zone: # Example: dal13
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 24Gi
    storageClassName: ibmc-block-silver
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Create the PVC in your cluster.
  ```
  kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
  ```
  {: pre}

3. After your PVC is bound, create an app deployment that uses your PVC. Create a file for your deployment and name it `deployment.yaml`.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: my-deployment
    labels:
      app: 
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: my-app
      spec:
        containers:
        - image: # Your contanerized app image.
          name: my-container
          volumeMounts:
          - name: my-volume
            mountPath: /mount-path
        volumes:
        - name: my-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-pvc
  ```
  {: codeblock}

3. Create the deployment in your cluster.
  ```
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  ```
  {: pre}

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plug-in in your cluster
{: #install_block}

Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plug-in with a Helm chart to set up pre-defined storage classes for {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}. You can use these storage classes to create a PVC to provision {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} for your apps.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. Make sure that your worker node applies the latest patch for your minor version to run your worker node with the latest security settings. The patch version also ensures that the root password on the worker node is renewed. 
   
   If you did not apply updates or reload your worker node within the last 90 days, your root password on the worker node expires and the installation of the storage plug-in might fail. 
   {: note}
   1. List the current patch version of your worker nodes.
      ```
      ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      OK
      ID                                                  Public IP        Private IP     Machine Type           State    Status   Zone    Version
      kube-dal10-crb1a23b456789ac1b20b2nc1e12b345ab-w26   169.xx.xxx.xxx    10.xxx.xx.xxx   b3c.4x16.encrypted     normal   Ready    dal10   1.15.10_1523*
      ```
      {: screen}

      If your worker node does not apply the latest patch version, you see an asterisk (`*`) in the **Version** column of your CLI output.

   2. Review the [version changelog](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) to find the changes that are included in the latest patch version.

   3. Apply the latest patch version by reloading your worker node. Follow the instructions in the [ibmcloud ks worker reload command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) to gracefully reschedule any running pods on your worker node before you reload your worker node. Note that during the reload, your worker node machine is updated with the latest image and data is deleted if not [stored outside the worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).


1.  [Follow the instructions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#install_v3) to install the Helm version 3 client on your local machine.


2. Add the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Helm chart repository to the cluster where you want to use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plug-in.

   ```
   helm repo add iks-charts https://icr.io/helm/iks-charts
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Update the Helm repo to retrieve the latest version of all Helm charts in this repo.
   ```
   helm repo update
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.
   ```
   helm install <release_name> iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin -n <namespace>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:

7. Repeat these steps for every cluster where you want to provision block storage.

You can now continue to [create a PVC](#add_block) to provision block storage for your app.


### Updating the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in
You can upgrade the existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in to the latest version.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. Update the Helm repo to retrieve the latest version of all Helm charts in this repo.
  ```
  helm repo update
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Optional: Download the latest Helm chart to your local machine. Then, extract the package and review the `release.md` file to find the latest release information.
  ```
  helm pull iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin --untar
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Find the release name and namespace of the block storage Helm chart that you installed in your cluster.
  ```
  helm ls -A
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:
  ```
  NAME        	NAMESPACE  	REVISION	    UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART                              	APP VERSION
  <release_name>	  <namespace>    	1       	2020-01-27 09:18:33.046018 -0500 EST	deployed	ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-1.6.0
  ```
  {: screen}

4. Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in to the latest version.
  ```
  helm upgrade <release_name> iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin -n <namespace>
  ```
  {: pre}

5. Optional: When you update the plug-in, the `default` storage class is unset. If you want to set the default storage class to a storage class of your choice, run the following command.
  ```
  kubectl patch storageclass <storageclass> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
  ```
  {: pre}

### Removing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in
If you do not want to provision and use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage in your cluster, you can uninstall the Helm chart.
{: shortdesc}

Removing the plug-in does not remove existing PVCs, PVs, or data. When you remove the plug-in, all the related pods and daemon sets are removed from your cluster. You cannot provision new block storage for your cluster or use existing block storage PVCs and PVs after you remove the plug-in.
{: important}

Before you begin:
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
- Make sure that you do not have any PVCs or PVs in your cluster that use block storage.

To remove the plug-in:

1. Find the release name and the namespace of the block storage Helm chart that you installed in your cluster.
  ```
  helm ls -A
  ```
  {: pre}

  Example output:
  ```
  NAME        	 NAMESPACE  	REVISION	    UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART                              	APP VERSION

  ```
  {: screen}

2. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in.
  ```
  helm uninstall <release_name> -n <namespace>
  ```
  {: pre}

3. Verify that the block storage pods are removed.
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n <namespace> | grep block
  ```
  {: pre}
  The removal of the pods is successful if no pods are displayed in your CLI output.

4. Verify that the block storage classes are removed.
  ```
  kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
  ```
  {: pre}
  The removal of the storage classes is successful if no storage classes are displayed in your CLI output.

<br />





## Deciding on the block storage configuration
{: #block_predefined_storageclass}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides pre-defined storage classes for block storage that you can use to provision block storage with a specific configuration.
{: shortdesc}

Every storage class specifies the type of block storage that you provision, including available size, IOPS, file system, and the retention policy.  

Make sure to choose your storage configuration carefully to have enough capacity to store your data. After you provision a specific type of storage by using a storage class, you cannot change the type or retention policy for the storage device. However, you can [change the size and the IOPS](#block_change_storage_configuration) if you want to increase your storage capacity and performance. To change the type and retention policy for your storage, you must [create a new storage instance and copy the data](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#update_storageclass) from the old storage instance to your new one.
{: important}

1. List available storage classes in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    $ kubectl get storageclasses
    NAME                         TYPE
    ibmc-block-custom            ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-bronze            ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-gold              ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-silver            ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-bronze     ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-silver     ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-gold       ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ibmc-block-retain-custom     ibm.io/ibmc-block
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Review the configuration of a storage class.
   ```
   kubectl describe storageclass <storageclass_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   For more information about each storage class, see the [storage class reference](#block_storageclass_reference). If you do not find what you are looking for, consider creating your own customized storage class. To get started, check out the [customized storage class samples](#block_custom_storageclass).
   {: tip}

3. Choose the type of block storage that you want to provision.
   - **Bronze, silver, and gold storage classes:** These storage classes provision [Endurance storage](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-About#provendurance). With Endurance storage, you can choose the size of the storage in gigabytes at predefined IOPS tiers.
   - **Custom storage class:** This storage class provisions [Performance storage](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-About#provperformance). With performance storage, you have more control over the size of the storage and the IOPS.

4. Choose the size and IOPS for your block storage. The size and the number of IOPS define the total number of IOPS (input/ output operations per second) that serves as an indicator for how fast your storage is. The more total IOPS your storage has, the faster it processes read and write operations.
   - **Bronze, silver, and gold storage classes:** These storage classes come with a fixed number of IOPS per gigabyte and are provisioned on SSD hard disks. The total number of IOPS depends on the size of the storage that you choose. You can select any whole number of gigabyte within the allowed size range, such as 20 Gi, 256 Gi, or 11854 Gi. To determine the total number of IOPS, you must multiply the IOPS with the selected size. For example, if you select a 1000Gi block storage size in the silver storage class that comes with 4 IOPS per GB, your storage has a total of 4000 IOPS.

         </tbody></table>
   - **Custom storage class:** When you choose this storage class, you have more control over the size and IOPS that you want. For the size, you can select any whole number of gigabyte within the allowed size range. The size that you choose determines the IOPS range that is available to you. You can choose an IOPS that is a multiple of 100 that is in the specified range. The IOPS that you choose is static and does not scale with the size of the storage. For example, if you choose 40Gi with 100 IOPS, your total IOPS remains 100. </br></br>The IOPS to gigabyte ratio also determines the type of hard disk that is provisioned for you. For example, if you have 500Gi at 100 IOPS, your IOPS to gigabyte ratio is 0.2. Storage with a ratio of less than or equal to 0.3 is provisioned on SATA hard disks. If your ratio is greater than 0.3, then your storage is provisioned on SSD hard disks.

5. Choose if you want to keep your data after the cluster or the persistent volume claim (PVC) is deleted.
   - If you want to keep your data, then choose a `retain` storage class. When you delete the PVC, only the PVC is deleted. The PV, the physical storage device in your IBM Cloud infrastructure account, and your data still exist. To reclaim the storage and use it in your cluster again, you must remove the PV and follow the steps for [using existing block storage](#existing_block).
   - If you want the PV, the data, and your physical block storage device to be deleted when you delete the PVC, choose a storage class without `retain`.

6. Choose if you want to be billed hourly or monthly. Check the [pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage/pricing){: external} for more information. By default, all block storage devices are provisioned with an hourly billing type.

## Adding block storage to apps
{: #add_block}

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to [dynamically provision](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#dynamic_provisioning) block storage for your cluster. Dynamic provisioning automatically creates the matching persistent volume (PV) and orders the actual storage device in your IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
{:shortdesc}

Block storage comes with a `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. You can mount it to only one pod on one worker node in the cluster at a time.
{: note}

Before you begin:
- If you have a firewall, [allow egress access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-firewall#pvc) for the IBM Cloud infrastructure IP ranges of the zones that your clusters are in so that you can create PVCs.
- Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} block storage plug-in](#install_block).
- [Decide on a pre-defined storage class](#block_predefined_storageclass) or create a [customized storage class](#block_custom_storageclass).

Looking to deploy block storage in a stateful set? For more information, see [Using block storage in a stateful set](#block_statefulset).
{: tip}

To add block storage:

1.  Create a configuration file to define your persistent volume claim (PVC) and save the configuration as a `.yaml` file.

    -  **Example for bronze, silver, gold storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the `"ibmc-block-silver"` storage class, billed `"hourly"`, with a gigabyte size of `24Gi`.

       ```yaml
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         labels:
           billingType: "hourly"
         region: us-south
           zone: dal13
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteOnce
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 24Gi
         storageClassName: ibmc-block-silver
       ```
       {: codeblock}

    -  **Example for using the custom storage class**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the storage class `ibmc-block-retain-custom`, billed `"hourly"`, with a gigabyte size of `45Gi` and IOPS of `"300"`.

       ```yaml
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         labels:
           billingType: "hourly"
         region: us-south
           zone: dal13
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteOnce
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 45Gi
             iops: "300"
         storageClassName: ibmc-block-retain-custom

## Using existing block storage in your cluster
{: #existing_block}

If you have an existing physical storage device that you want to use in your cluster, you can manually create the PV and PVC to [statically provision](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#static_provisioning) the storage.
{: shortdesc}

Before you can start to mount your existing storage to an app, you must retrieve all necessary information for your PV.  

### Step 1: Retrieving the information of your existing block storage
{: #existing-block-1}

1.  Retrieve or generate an API key for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
    1. Log in to the [IBM Cloud infrastructure portal](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic){: external}.
    2. Select **Account**, then **Users**, and then **User List**.
    3. Find your user ID.
    4. In the **API KEY** column, click **Generate** to generate an API key or **View** to view your existing API key.
2.  Retrieve the API username for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
    1. From the **User List** menu, select your user ID.
    2. In the **API Access Information** section, find your **API Username**.
3.  Log in to the IBM Cloud infrastructure CLI plug-in.
    ```
    ibmcloud sl init
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  Choose to authenticate by using the username and API key for your IBM Cloud infrastructure account.
5.  Enter the username and API key that you retrieved in the previous steps.
6.  List available block storage devices.
    ```
    ibmcloud sl block volume-list
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    id         username            datacenter   storage_type              capacity_gb   bytes_used   ip_addr         lunId   active_transactions
    38642141   IBM02SEL1543159-1   dal10        endurance_block_storage   20            -            169.xx.xxx.xxx   170     0
    ```
    {: screen}

7.  Note the `id`, `ip_addr`, `capacity_gb`, the `datacenter`, and `lunId` of the block storage device that you want to mount to your cluster. **Note:** To mount existing storage to a cluster, you must have a worker node in the same zone as your storage. To verify the zone of your worker node, run `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.

### Step 2: Creating a persistent volume (PV) and a matching persistent volume claim (PVC)
{: #existing-block-2}

1.  Optional: If you have storage that you provisioned with a `retain` storage class, when you remove the PVC, the PV and the physical storage device are not removed. To reuse the storage in your cluster, you must remove the PV first.
    1. List existing PVs.
       ```
       kubectl get pv
       ```
       {: pre}

       Look for the PV that belongs to your persistent storage. The PV is in a `released` state.

    2. Remove the PV.
       ```
       kubectl delete pv <pv_name>
       ```
       {: pre}

    3. Verify that the PV is removed.
       ```
       kubectl get pv
       ```
       {: pre}

2.  Create a configuration file for your PV. Include the block storage `id`, `ip_addr`, `capacity_gb`, the `datacenter`, and `lunIdID` that you retrieved earlier.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: mypv
      labels:
         failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region: <region>
         failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone: <zone>
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: "<storage_size>"
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      flexVolume:
        driver: "ibm/ibmc-block"
        fsType: "<fs_type>"
        options:
          "Lun": "<lun_ID>"
          "TargetPortal": "<IP_address>"
          "VolumeID": "<volume_ID>"
          "volumeName": "<volume_name>"
      ```

    <tr>
    <td><code>spec.capacity.storage</code></td>
    <td>Enter the storage size of the existing block storage that you retrieved in the previous step as <code>capacity-gb</code>. The storage size must be written in gigabytes, for example, 20Gi (20 GB) or 1000Gi (1 TB).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>flexVolume.options.Lun</code></td>
    <td>Enter the lun ID for your block storage that you retrieved earlier as <code>lunId</code>.</td>

	    <tr>
		    <td><code>flexVolume.options.volumeName</code></td>
		    <td>Enter a name for your volume.</td>
	    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

3.  Create the PV in your cluster.
    ```
    kubectl apply -f mypv.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Verify that the PV is created.
    ```
    kubectl get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

5. Create another configuration file to create your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV that you created earlier, you must choose the same value for `storage` and `accessMode`. The `storage-class` field must be an empty string. If any of these fields do not match the PV, then a new PV is created automatically instead.

     ```yaml
     kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
     apiVersion: v1
     metadata:
      name: mypvc
     spec:
      accessModes:

## Using block storage in a stateful set
{: #block_statefulset}

If you have a stateful app such as a database, you can create stateful sets that use block storage to store your app's data. Alternatively, you can use an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} database-as-a-service and store your data in the cloud.
{: shortdesc}

**What do I need to be aware of when adding block storage to a stateful set?** </br>
To add storage to a stateful set, you specify your storage configuration in the `volumeClaimTemplates` section of your stateful set YAML. The `volumeClaimTemplates` is the basis for your PVC and can include the storage class and the size or IOPS of your block storage that you want to provision. However, if you want to include labels in your `volumeClaimTemplates`, Kubernetes does not include these labels when creating the PVC. Instead, you must add the labels directly to your stateful set.

You cannot deploy two stateful sets at the same time. If you try to create a stateful set before a different one is fully deployed, then the deployment of your stateful set might lead to unexpected results.
{: important}

**How can I create my stateful set in a specific zone?** </br>
In a multizone cluster, you can specify the zone and region where you want to create your stateful set in the `spec.selector.matchLabels` and `spec.template.metadata.labels` section of your stateful set YAML. Alternatively, you can add those labels to a [customized storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#customized_storageclass) and use this storage class in the `volumeClaimTemplates` section of your stateful set.

**Can I delay binding of a PV to my stateful pod until the pod is ready?**<br>
Yes, you can [create a custom storage class](#topology_yaml) for your PVC that includes the [`volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode){: external} field.

**What options do I have to add block storage to a stateful set?** </br>
If you want to automatically create your PVC when you create the stateful set, use [dynamic provisioning](#block_dynamic_statefulset). You can also choose to [pre-provision your PVCs or use existing PVCs](#block_static_statefulset) with your stateful set.  

### Dynamic provisioning: Creating the PVC when you create a stateful set
{: #block_dynamic_statefulset}

Use this option if you want to automatically create the PVC when you create the stateful set.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. Verify that all existing stateful sets in your cluster are fully deployed. If a stateful set is still being deployed, you cannot start creating your stateful set. You must wait until all stateful sets in your cluster are fully deployed to avoid unexpected results.
   1. List existing stateful sets in your cluster.
      ```
      kubectl get statefulset --all-namespaces
      ```

   2. View the **Pods Status** of each stateful set to ensure that the deployment of the stateful set is finished.  
      ```
      kubectl describe statefulset <statefulset_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```

      A stateful set is fully deployed when the number of replicas that you find in the **Replicas** section of your CLI output equals the number of **Running** pods in the **Pods Status** section. If a stateful set is not fully deployed yet, wait until the deployment is finished before you proceed.

2. Create a configuration file for your stateful set and the service that you use to expose the stateful set.

   - **Example stateful set that specifies a zone:**

     The following example shows how to deploy NGINX as a stateful set with three replicas. For each replica, a 20 gigabyte block storage device is provisioned based on the specifications that are defined in the `ibmc-block-retain-bronze` storage class. All storage devices are provisioned in the `dal10` zone. Because block storage cannot be accessed from other zones, all replicas of the stateful set are also deployed onto worker nodes that are located in `dal10`.

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        app: nginx

      clusterIP: None
      selector:

            image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80

         storageClassName: ibmc-block-retain-bronze
     ```
     {: codeblock}

   - **Example stateful set with anti-affinity rule and delayed block storage creation:**

     The following example shows how to deploy NGINX as a stateful set with three replicas. The stateful set does not specify the region and zone where the block storage is created. Instead, the stateful set uses an anti-affinity rule to ensure that the pods are spread across worker nodes and zones. By defining `topologykey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`, the Kubernetes scheduler cannot schedule a pod on a worker node if the worker node is in the same zone as a pod that has the `app: nginx` label. For each stateful set pod, two PVCs are created as defined in the `volumeClaimTemplates` section, but the creation of the block storage instances is delayed until a stateful set pod that uses the storage is scheduled. This setup is referred to as [topology-aware volume scheduling](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/11/topology-aware-volume-provisioning-in-kubernetes/).

4. Create your stateful set.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f statefulset.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Wait for your stateful set to be deployed.
   ```
   kubectl describe statefulset <statefulset_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   To see the current status of your PVCs, run `kubectl get pvc`. The name of your PVC is formatted as `<volume_name>-<statefulset_name>-<replica_number>`.
   {: tip}

### Static provisioning: Using existing PVCs with a stateful set
{: #block_static_statefulset}

You can pre-provision your PVCs before creating your stateful set or use existing PVCs with your stateful set.
{: shortdesc}

When you [dynamically provision your PVCs when creating the stateful set](#block_dynamic_statefulset), the name of the PVC is assigned based on the values that you used in the stateful set YAML file. In order for the stateful set to use existing PVCs, the name of your PVCs must match the name that would automatically be created when using dynamic provisioning.

Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

1. If you want to pre-provision the PVC for your stateful set before you create the stateful set, follow steps 1-3 in [Adding block storage to apps](#add_block) to create a PVC for each stateful set replica. Make sure that you create your PVC with a name that follows the following format: `<volume_name>-<statefulset_name>-<replica_number>`.
   - **`<volume_name>`**: Use the name that you want to specify in the `spec.volumeClaimTemplates.metadata.name` section of your stateful set, such as `nginxvol`.
   - **`<statefulset_name>`**: Use the name that you want to specify in the `metadata.name` section of your stateful set, such as `nginx_statefulset`.
   - **`<replica_number>`**: Enter the number of your replica, starting with 0.

   For example, if you must create three stateful set replicas, create three PVCs with the following names: `nginxvol-nginx_statefulset-0`, `nginxvol-nginx_statefulset-1`, and `nginxvol-nginx_statefulset-2`.  

   Looking to create a PVC and PV for an existing storage device? Create your PVC and PV by using [static provisioning](#existing_block).

2. Follow the steps in [Dynamic provisioning: Creating the PVC when you create a stateful set](#block_dynamic_statefulset) to create your stateful set. The name of your PVC follows the format `<volume_name>-<statefulset_name>-<replica_number>`. Make sure to use the following values from your PVC name in the stateful set specification:
   - **`spec.volumeClaimTemplates.metadata.name`**: Enter the `<volume_name>` of your PVC name.
   - **`metadata.name`**: Enter the `<statefulset_name>` of your PVC name.
   - **`spec.replicas`**: Enter the number of replicas that you want to create for your stateful set. The number of replicas must equal the number of PVCs that you created earlier.

   If your PVCs are in different zones, do not include a region or zone label in your stateful set.
   {: note}

3. Verify that the PVCs are used in your stateful set replica pods.
   1. List the pods in your cluster. Identify the pods that belong to your stateful set.
      ```
      kubectl get pods
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Verify that your existing PVC is mounted to your stateful set replica. Review the **`ClaimName`** in the **`Volumes`** section of your CLI output.
      ```
      kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      Name:           nginx-0

## Changing the size and IOPS of your existing storage device
{: #block_change_storage_configuration}

If you want to increase storage capacity or performance, you can modify your existing volume.
{: shortdesc}

For questions about billing and to find the steps for how to use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console to modify your storage, see [Expanding Block Storage capacity](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-expandingcapacity#expandingcapacity) and [Adjusting IOPS](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-adjustingIOPS). Updates that you make from the console are not reflected in the persistent volume (PV). To add this information to the PV, run `kubectl patch pv <pv_name>` and manually update the size and IOPS in the **Labels** and **Annotation** section of your PV.
{: tip}


1. List the PVCs in your cluster and note the name of the associated PV from the **VOLUME** column.
   ```
   kubectl get pvc
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   NAME             STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS        AGE
   myvol            Bound     pvc-01ac123a-123b-12c3-abcd-0a1234cb12d3   20Gi       RWO            ibmc-block-bronze    147d
   ```
   {: screen}

2. If you want to change the IOPS and the size for your block storage, edit the IOPS in the `metadata.labels.IOPS` section of your PV first. You can change to a lower or greater IOPS value. Make sure that you enter an IOPS that is supported for the storage type that you have. For example, if you have endurance block storage with 4 IOPS, you can change the IOPS to either 2 or 10. For more supported IOPS values, see [Deciding on your block storage configuration](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#block_predefined_storageclass).
   ```
   kubectl edit pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   To change the IOPS from the CLI, you must also change the size of your block storage. If you want to change only the IOPS, but not the size, you must [request the IOPS change from the console](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-adjustingIOPS).
   {: note}

3. Edit the PVC and add the new size in the `spec.resources.requests.storage` section of your PVC. You can change to a greater size only up to the maximum capacity that is set by your storage class. You cannot downsize your existing storage. To see available sizes for your storage class, see [Deciding on the block storage configuration](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#block_predefined_storageclass).
   ```
   kubectl edit pvc <pvc_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Verify that the volume expansion is requested. The volume expansion is successfully requested when you see a `FileSystemResizePending` message in the **Conditions** section of your CLI output.
   ```
   kubectl describe pvc <pvc_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   ...
   Conditions:
   Type                      Status  LastProbeTime                     LastTransitionTime                Reason  Message
   ----                      ------  -----------------                 ------------------                ------  -------
   FileSystemResizePending   True    Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000   Thu, 25 Apr 2019 15:52:49 -0400           Waiting for user to (re-)start a pod to finish file system resize of volume on node.
   ```
   {: screen}

5. List all the pods that mount the PVC. If your PVC is mounted by a pod, the volume expansion is automatically processed. If your PVC is not mounted by a pod, you must mount the PVC to a pod so that the volume expansion can be processed.
   ```
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"
   ```
   {: pre}

   Mounted pods are returned in the format: `<pod_name>: <pvc_name>`.

6. If your PVC is not mounted by a pod, [create a pod or deployment and mount the PVC](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#add_block). If your PVC is mounted by a pod, continue with the next step.

7. Verify that the size and IOPS are changed in the **Labels** section of your CLI output. This process might take a few minutes to complete.
   ```
   kubectl describe pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   ...
   Labels:       CapacityGb=50
                 Datacenter=dal10
                 IOPS=500

## Backing up and restoring data
{: #block_backup_restore}

Block storage is provisioned into the same location as the worker nodes in your cluster. The storage is hosted on clustered servers by IBM to provide availability in case a server goes down. However, block storage is not backed up automatically and might be inaccessible if the entire location fails. To protect your data from being lost or damaged, you can set up periodic backups that you can use to restore your data when needed.
{: shortdesc}

Review the following backup and restore options for your block storage:

<dl>
  <dt>Set up periodic snapshots</dt>
  <dd><p>You can [set up periodic snapshots for your block storage](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-snapshots#snapshots), which is a read-only image that captures the state of the instance at a point in time. To store the snapshot, you must request snapshot space on your block storage. Snapshots are stored on the existing storage instance within the same zone.

## Sample customized storage classes
{: #block_custom_storageclass}

You can create a customized storage class and use the storage class in your PVC.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} provides [pre-defined storage classes](#block_storageclass_reference) to provision block storage with a particular tier and configuration. In some cases, you might want to provision storage with a different configuration that is not covered in the pre-defined storage classes. You can use the examples in this topic to find sample customized storage classes.

To create your customized storage class, see [Customizing a storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#customized_storageclass). Then, [use your customized storage class in your PVC](#add_block).

### Creating topology-aware storage
{: #topology_yaml}

To use block storage in a multizone cluster, your pod must be scheduled in the same zone as your block storage instance so that you can read and write to the volume. Before topology-aware volume scheduling was introduced by Kubernetes, the dynamic provisioning of your storage automatically created the block storage instance when a PVC was created. Then, when you created your pod, the Kubernetes scheduler tried to deploy the pod to the same data center as your block storage instance.
{: shortdesc}

Creating the block storage instance without knowing the constraints of the pod can lead to unwanted results. For example, your pod might not be able to be scheduled to the same worker node as your storage because the worker node has insufficient resources or the worker node is tainted and does not allow the pod to be scheduled. With topology-aware volume scheduling, the block storage instance is delayed until the first pod that uses the storage is created.

Topology-aware volume scheduling is supported on clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.12 or later only. To use this feature, make sure that you installed the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in version 1.2.0 or later.
{: note}

The following examples show how to create storage classes that delay the creation of the block storage instance until the first pod that uses this storage is ready to be scheduled. To delay the creation, you must include the `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` option. If you do not include this option, the `volumeBindingMode` is automatically set to `Immediate` and the block storage instance is created when you create the PVC.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1

   type: "Performance"
  reclaimPolicy: Delete

  ```
  {: codeblock}

### Specifying the zone and region
{: #block_multizone_yaml}

If you want to create your block storage in a specific zone, you can specify the zone and region in a customized storage class.
{: shortdesc}

Use the customized storage class if you use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Block Storage plug-in version 1.0.0 or if you want to [statically provision block storage](#existing_block) in a specific zone. In all other cases, [specify the zone directly in your PVC](#add_block).
{: note}

The following `.yaml` file customizes a storage class that is based on the `ibm-block-silver` non-retaining storage class: the `type` is `"Endurance"`, the `iopsPerGB` is `4`, the `sizeRange` is `"[20-12000]Gi"`, and the `reclaimPolicy` is set to `"Delete"`. The zone is specified as `dal12`. To use a different storage class as your base, see the [storage class reference](#block_storageclass_reference).

Create the storage class in the same region and zone as your cluster and worker nodes. To get the region of your cluster, run `ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>` and look for the region prefix in the **Master URL**, such as `eu-de` in `https://c2.eu-de.containers.cloud.ibm.com:11111`. To get the zone of your worker node, run `ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>`.

## Removing persistent storage from a cluster
{: #cleanup}

When you set up persistent storage in your cluster, you have three main components: the Kubernetes persistent volume claim (PVC) that requests storage, the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) that is mounted to a pod and described in the PVC, and the IBM Cloud infrastructure instance, such as classic file or block storage. Depending on how you created your storage, you might need to delete all three components separately. 
{:shortdesc}

### Understanding your storage removal options
{: #storage_delete_options}

Removing persistent storage from your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account varies depending on how you provisioned the storage and what components you already removed.
{: shortdesc}

**Is my persistent storage deleted when I delete my cluster?**</br>
During cluster deletion, you have the option to remove your persistent storage. However, depending on how your storage was provisioned, the removal of your storage might not include all storage components.

If you [dynamically provisioned](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#dynamic_provisioning) storage with a storage class that sets `reclaimPolicy: Delete`, your PVC, PV, and the storage instance are automatically deleted when you delete the cluster. For storage that was [statically provisioned](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#static_provisioning), VPC Block Storage, or storage that you provisioned with a storage class that sets `reclaimPolicy: Retain`, the PVC and the PV are removed when you delete the cluster, but your storage instance and your data remain. You are still charged for your storage instance. Also, if you deleted your cluster in an unhealthy state, the storage might still exist even if you chose to remove it.

**How do I delete the storage when I want to keep my cluster?** </br>
When you dynamically provisioned the storage with a storage class that sets `reclaimPolicy: Delete`, you can remove the PVC to start the deletion process of your persistent storage. Your PVC, PV, and storage instance are automatically removed.

For storage that was [statically provisioned](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#static_provisioning), VPC Block Storage, or storage that you provisioned with a storage class that sets `reclaimPolicy: Retain`, you must manually remove the PVC, PV, and the storage instance to avoid further charges.

**How does the billing stop after I delete my storage?**</br>
Depending on what storage components you delete and when, the billing cycle might not stop immediately. If you delete the PVC and PV, but not the storage instance in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, that instance still exists and you are charged for it.

If you delete the PVC, PV, and the storage instance, the billing cycle stops depending on the `billingType` that you chose when you provisioned your storage and how you chose to delete the storage.

- When you manually cancel the persistent storage instance from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or the `ibmcloud sl` CLI, billing stops as follows:
  - **Hourly storage**: Billing stops immediately. After your storage is canceled, you might still see your storage instance in the console for up to 72 hours.
  - **Monthly storage**: You can choose between immediate cancellation or cancellation on the anniversary date. In both cases, you are billed until the end of the current billing cycle, and billing stops for the next billing cycle. After your storage is canceled, you might still see your storage instance in the console or the CLI for up to 72 hours.
    - **Immediate cancellation**: Choose this option to immediately remove your storage. Neither you nor your users can use the storage anymore or recover the data.
    - **Anniversary date**: Choose this option to cancel your storage on the next anniversary date. Your storage instances remain active until the next anniversary date and you can continue to use them until this date, such as to give your team time to make backups of your data.

- When you dynamically provisioned the storage with a storage class that sets `reclaimPolicy: Delete` and you choose to remove the PVC, the PV and the storage instance are immediately removed. For hourly billed storage, billing stops immediately. For monthly billed storage, you are still charged for the remainder of the month. After your storage is removed and billing stops, you might still see your storage instance in the console or the CLI for up to 72 hours.

**What do I need to be aware of before I delete persistent storage?** </br>
When you clean up persistent storage, you delete all the data that is stored in it. If you need a copy of the data, make a backup for [file storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage#file_backup_restore) or [block storage](/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#block_backup_restore).

**I deleted my storage instance. Why can I still see my instance?** </br>
After you remove persistent storage, it can take up to 72 hours for the removal to be fully processed and for the storage to disappear from your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or CLI.


### Cleaning up persistent storage
{: #storage_remove}

Remove the PVC, PV, and the storage instance from your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to avoid further charges for your persistent storage.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin:
- Make sure that you backed up any data that you want to keep.
- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To clean up persistent data:

1.  List the PVCs in your cluster and note the **`NAME`** of the PVC, the **`STORAGECLASS`**, and the name of the PV that is bound to the PVC and shown as **`VOLUME`**.
    ```
    kubectl get pvc
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    NAME                  STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STORAGECLASS            AGE
    claim1-block-bronze   Bound     pvc-06886b77-102b-11e8-968a-f6612bb731fb   20Gi       RWO           ibmc-block-bronze       78d
    claim-file-bronze     Bound     pvc-457a2b96-fafc-11e7-8ff9-b6c8f770356c   4Gi        RWX           ibmc-file-bronze-retain 105d
    claim-file-silve      Bound     pvc-1efef0ba-0c48-11e8-968a-f6612bb731fb   24Gi       RWX           ibmc-file-silver        83d
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Review the **`ReclaimPolicy`** and **`billingType`** for the storage class.
   ```
   kubectl describe storageclass <storageclass_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   If the reclaim policy says `Delete`, your PV and the physical storage are removed when you remove the PVC. Note that VPC Block Storage is not removed automatically, even if you used a `Delete` storage class to provision the storage. If the reclaim policy says `Retain`, or if you provisioned your storage without a storage class, then your PV and physical storage are not removed when you remove the PVC. You must remove the PVC, PV, and the physical storage separately.

   If your storage is charged monthly, you still get charged for the entire month, even if you remove the storage before the end of the billing cycle.

3. Remove any pods that mount the PVC.
   1. List the pods that mount the PVC.
      ```
      kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"
      ```
      {: pre}

      Example output:
      ```
      blockdepl-12345-prz7b:	claim1-block-bronze  
      ```
      {: screen}

      If no pod is returned in your CLI output, you do not have a pod that uses the PVC.

   2. Remove the pod that uses the PVC. If the pod is part of a deployment, remove the deployment.
      ```
      kubectl delete pod <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Verify that the pod is removed.
      ```
      kubectl get pods
      ```
      {: pre}

4. Remove the PVC.
   ```
   kubectl delete pvc <pvc_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Review the status of your PV. Use the name of the PV that you retrieved earlier as **`VOLUME`**.
   ```
   kubectl get pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

   When you remove the PVC, the PV that is bound to the PVC is released. Depending on how you provisioned your storage, your PV goes into a `Deleting` state if the PV is deleted automatically, or into a `Released` state, if you must manually delete the PV. **Note**: For PVs that are automatically deleted, the status might briefly say `Released` before it is deleted. Rerun the command after a few minutes to see whether the PV is removed.

6. If your PV is not deleted, manually remove the PV.
   ```
   kubectl delete pv <pv_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

7. Verify that the PV is removed.
   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```
   {: pre}

   

8. {: #sl_delete_storage}List the physical storage instance that your PV pointed to and note the **`id`** of the physical storage instance.

    ```
    ibmcloud sl block volume-list --columns id --columns notes | grep <pv_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    12345678   {"plugin":"ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-689df949d6-4n9qg","region":"us-south","cluster":"aa1a11a1a11b2b2bb22b22222c3c3333","type":"Endurance","ns":"default","pvc":"mypvc","pv":"pvc-d979977d-d79d-77d9-9d7d-d7d97ddd99d7","storageclass":"ibmc-block-silver","reclaim":"Delete"}
    ```
    {: screen}

    Understanding the **Notes** field information:
    *  **`"plugin":"ibm-file-plugin-5b55b7b77b-55bb7"`**: The storage plug-in that the cluster uses.
    *  **`"region":"us-south"`**: The region that your cluster is in.
    *  **`"cluster":"aa1a11a1a11b2b2bb22b22222c3c3333"`**: The cluster ID that is associated with the storage instance.
    *  **`"type":"Endurance"`**: The type of file or block storage, either `Endurance` or `Performance`.
    *  **`"ns":"default"`**: The namespace that the storage instance is deployed to.
    *  **`"pvc":"mypvc"`**: The name of the PVC that is associated with the storage instance.
    *  **`"pv":"pvc-d979977d-d79d-77d9-9d7d-d7d97ddd99d7"`**: The PV that is associated with the storage instance.
    *  **`"storageclass":"ibmc-file-gold"`**: The type of storage class: bronze, silver, gold, or custom.

9. Remove the physical storage instance.

    ```
    ibmcloud sl block volume-cancel <classic_block_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

10. Verify that the physical storage instance is removed.

    The deletion process might take up to 72 hours to complete.
