## Cluster management responsibilities
{: #responsibilities}

Review the responsibilities that you share with IBM to manage your clusters.
{:shortdesc}

**IBM is responsible for:**

- Deploying the master, worker nodes, and management components within the cluster, such as Ingress application load balancer, at cluster creation time
- Managing the security updates, monitoring, isolation, and recovery of the Kubernetes master for the cluster
- Monitoring the health of the worker nodes and providing automation for the update and recovery of those worker nodes
- Performing automation tasks against your infrastructure account, including adding worker nodes, removing worker nodes, and creating a default subnet
- Managing, updating, and recovering operational components within the cluster, such as the Ingress application load balancer and the storage plug-in
- Provisioning of storage volumes when requested by persistent volume claims
- Providing security settings on all worker nodes

**You are responsible for:**

- [Configuring your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account to access the IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) portfolio](cs_troubleshoot_clusters.html#cs_credentials)
- [Deploying and managing Kubernetes resources, such as pods, services, and deployments, within the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli)
- [Leveraging the capabilities of the service and Kubernetes to ensure high availability of apps](cs_app.html#highly_available_apps)
- [Adding or removing cluster capacity by using the CLI to add or remove worker nodes](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_add)
- [Creating public and private VLANs in IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) for network isolation of your cluster](/docs/infrastructure/vlans/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-vlans)
- [Ensuring that all worker nodes have network connectivity to the Kubernetes master URL](cs_firewall.html#firewall) <p>**Note**: If a worker node has both public and private VLANs, then network connectivity is configured. If worker nodes are set up with a private VLAN only, you must configure an alternative solution for network connectivity. For more information, see [VLAN connection for worker nodes](cs_clusters.html#worker_vlan_connection). </p>
- [Updating the master kube-apiserver when Kubernetes version updates are available](cs_cluster_update.html#master)
- [Keeping the worker nodes up-to-date on major, minor, and patch versions](cs_cluster_update.html#worker_node)
- [Recovering troubled worker nodes by running `kubectl` commands, such as `cordon` or `drain`, and by running `ic cs` commands, such as `reboot`, `reload`, or `delete`](cs_cli_reference.html#cs_worker_reboot)
- [Adding or removing subnets in IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) as needed](cs_subnets.html#subnets)
- [Backing up and restoring data in persistent storage in IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](../services/RegistryImages/ibm-backup-restore/index.html)
