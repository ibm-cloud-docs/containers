# Why can't my PVC access an existing bucket?
{: #cos_access_bucket_fails}
{: support}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}



When you create the PVC, the bucket in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} can't be accessed. You see an error message similar to the following:
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh

You might have used the wrong storage class to access your existing bucket, you tried to access a bucket that you did not create, or there has been a change in the endpoints that are used in the storage class. You can't access a bucket that you did not create.
{: tsCauses}


Verify your bucket details and storage class and recreate your PVC.
