# Why can't my PVC access an existing bucket?
{: #cos_access_bucket_fails}
{: support}

Supported infrastructure providers
:   Classic
:   VPC



When you create the PVC, the bucket in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} can't be accessed. You see an error message similar to the following:
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
Failed to provision volume with StorageClass "ibmc-s3fs-standard-regional": pvc:1b2345678b69175abc98y873e2:can't access bucket <bucket_name>: NotFound: Not Found
```
{: screen}


You might have used the wrong storage class to access your existing bucket, or you tried to access a bucket that you did not create. You can't access a bucket that you did not create.
{: tsCauses}


Verify your bucket details and storage class and recreate your PVC.
{: tsResolve}

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}, select your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance.
2. Select **Buckets**.
3. Review the **Class** and **Location** information for your existing bucket.
4. Choose the appropriate [storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_reference).
5. Make sure that you provide the correct name of your existing bucket.
