# Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in on VPC and classic clusters
{: #storage_cos_install}

Install the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in with a Helm chart to set up pre-defined storage classes for {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. You can use these storage classes to create a PVC to provision {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} for your apps.
{: shortdesc}

If you are migrating from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8, you must uninstall and then reinstall the plug-in version 2.2.6 or later. Then, recreate your PVC and workload pods.
{: important}

Prequisites
:   The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in requires at least 0.2 vCPU and 128 MB of memory.


Before you begin: [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)

To install the `ibmc` Helm plug-in and the `ibm-object-storage-plugin`:

1. Make sure that your worker node applies the latest patch for your minor version to run your worker node with the latest security settings. The patch version also ensures that the root password on the worker node is renewed. 

    If you did not apply updates or reload your worker node within the last 90 days, your root password on the worker node expires and the installation of the storage plug-in might fail. 
    {: note}

    1. List the current patch version of your worker nodes.
        ```sh
        ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output
        ```sh
        OK
        ID                                                  Public IP        Private IP     Machine Type           State    Status   Zone    Version
        kube-dal10-crb1a23b456789ac1b20b2nc1e12b345ab-w26   169.xx.xxx.xxx    10.xxx.xx.xxx   b3c.4x16.encrypted     normal   Ready    dal10   1.25_1523*
        ```
        {: screen}

        If your worker node does not apply the latest patch version, you see an asterisk (`*`) in the **Version** column of your CLI output.

    2. Review the [version changelog](/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) to find the changes that are in the latest patch version.

    3. Apply the latest patch version by reloading your worker node. Follow the instructions in the [ibmcloud ks worker reload command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) to safely reschedule any running pods on your worker node before you reload your worker node. Note that during the reload, your worker node machine is updated with the latest image and data is deleted if not [stored outside the worker node](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).
1. Review the change log and verify support for your [cluster version and architecture](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cos_plugin_changelog).
1. [Follow the instructions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-helm#install_v3) to install the version 3 Helm client on your local machine.

    If you enabled [VRF](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#vrf) and [service endpoints](/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#service-endpoint) in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, you can use the private {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Helm repository to keep your image pull traffic on the private network. If you can't enable VRF or service endpoints in your account, use the public Helm repository.
    {: note}

1. Add the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Helm repo to your cluster.

    ```sh
    helm repo add ibm-helm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/ibm-helm
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Update the Helm repos to retrieve the most recent version of all Helm charts in this repo.
    ```sh
    helm repo update
    ```
    {: pre}

1. If you installed the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} Helm plug-in earlier, remove the `ibmc` plug-in.
    ```sh
    helm plugin uninstall ibmc
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Download the Helm charts and unpack the charts in your current directory.

    ```sh
    helm fetch --untar ibm-helm/ibm-object-storage-plugin
    ```
    {: pre}

    If the output shows `Error: failed to untar: a file or directory with the name ibm-object-storage-plugin already exists`, delete your `ibm-object-storage-plugin` directory and rerun the `helm fetch` command.
    {: tip}

1. If you use OS X or a Linux distribution, install the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} Helm plug-in `ibmc`. The plug-in automatically retrieves your cluster location and to set the API endpoint for your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets in your storage classes. If you use Windows as your operating system, continue with the next step.
    1. Install the Helm plug-in.
        ```sh
        helm plugin install ./ibm-object-storage-plugin/helm-ibmc
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Verify that the `ibmc` plug-in is installed successfully.
        ```sh
        helm ibmc --help
        ```
        {: pre}

        If the output shows the error `Error: fork/exec /home/iksadmin/.helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh: permission denied`, run `chmod 755 /Users/<user_name>/Library/helm/plugins/helm-ibmc/ibmc.sh`. Then, rerun `helm ibmc --help`.
        {: tip}


1. **Optional**: Limit the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in to access only the Kubernetes secrets that hold your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service credentials. By default, the plug-in can access all Kubernetes secrets in your cluster.
    1. [Create your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-cos-understand#create_cos_service).
    2. [Store your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service credentials in a Kubernetes secret](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-cos-understand#create_cos_secret)).
    3. From the `ibm-object-storage-plugin`, navigate to the `templates` directory and list available files.
        **OS X and Linux**

        ```sh
        cd templates && ls
        ```
        {: pre}

        **Windows**

        ```sh
        chdir templates && dir
        ```
        {: pre}

    4. Open the `provisioner-sa.yaml` file and look for the `ibmcloud-object-storage-secret-reader` `ClusterRole` definition.
    5. Add the name of the secret that you created earlier to the list of secrets that the plug-in is authorized to access in the `resourceNames` section.
        ```yaml
        kind: ClusterRole
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
        metadata:
         name: ibmcloud-object-storage-secret-reader
        rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["secrets"]
          resourceNames: ["<secret_name1>","<secret_name2>"]
          verbs: ["get"]
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    6. Save your changes and navigate to your working directory.


1. Install the `ibm-object-storage-plugin` in your cluster. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined storage classes are added to your cluster. If you completed the previous step for limiting the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in to access only the Kubernetes secrets that hold your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service credentials and you are still targeting the `templates` directory, change directories to your working directory. To set a limit on how much storage is available for the bucket, set the `--set quotaLimit=true` **VPC clusters only**: To enable authorized IPs on VPC, set the `--set bucketAccessPolicy=true` option.

If you don't set the `--set quotaLimit=true` option during installation, you can't set quotas for your PVCs.
{: note}


Example `helm ibmc install` commands for OS X and Linux


```sh
helm ibmc install ibm-object-storage-plugin ibm-helm/ibm-object-storage-plugin --set license=true [--set quotaLimit=true/false] [--set bucketAccessPolicy=false] 
```
{: pre}

`quotaLimit`
:   A quota limit sets the maximum amount of storage (in bytes) available for a bucket. If you set this option to `true`, then when you create PVCs, the quota on buckets created by those PVCs is equal to the 

Example `helm install` command for Windows.

```sh
helm install ibm-object-storage-plugin ./ibm-object-storage-plugin --set dcname="${DC_NAME}" --set provider="${CLUSTER_PROVIDER}" --set workerOS="${WORKER_OS}" --region="${REGION} --set platform="${PLATFORM}" --set license=true [--set bucketAccessPolicy=false]
```
{: pre}


`DC_NAME`
:   The cluster data center. To retrieve the data center, run `kubectl get cm cluster-info -n kube-system -o jsonpath="{.data.cluster-config\.json}{'\n'}"`. Store the data center value in an environment variable by running `SET DC_NAME=<datacenter>`. Optional: Set the environment variable in Windows PowerShell by running `$env:DC_NAME="<datacenter>"`.

`CLUSTER_PROVIDER`
:   The infrastructure provider. To retrieve this value, run `kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.labels.ibm-cloud\.kubernetes\.io\/iaas-provider}{'\n'}"`. If the output from the previous step contains `softlayer`, then set the `CLUSTER_PROVIDER` to `"IBMC"`. If the output contains `gc`, `ng`, or `g2`, then set the `CLUSTER_PROVIDER` to `"IBMC-VPC"`. Store the infrastructure provider in an environment variable. For example: `SET CLUSTER_PROVIDER="IBMC-VPC"`.

`WORKER_OS` and `PLATFORM`
:   The operating system of the worker nodes. To retrieve these values, run `kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.labels.ibm-cloud\.kubernetes\.io\/os}{'\n'}"`. Store the operating system of the worker nodes in an environment variable. For {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters, run `SET WORKER_OS="debian"` and `SET PLATFORM="k8s"`. 

`REGION`
:   The region of the worker nodes. To retrieve this value, run `kubectl get nodes -o yaml | grep 'ibm-cloud\.kubernetes\.io/region'`. Store the region of the worker nodes in an environment variable by running `SET REGION="< region>"`.

## Updating the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in
{: #update_cos_plugin}

You can upgrade the existing {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in to the most recent version.
{: shortdesc}

If you are upgrading from an older chart version before `2.2.5`, uninstall and reinstall the plug-in and re-create the PVC, pods, and storage classes or the upgrade will fail.
{: note}

1. Get the name of your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in Helm release and the version of the plug-in in your cluster.

If you're having trouble updating the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in, see [Object storage: Installing the Object storage `ibmc` Helm plug-in fails](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cos_helm_fails) and [Object storage: Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in fails](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cos_plugin_fails).
{: tip}

## Removing the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in
{: #remove_cos_plugin}

If you don't want to provision and use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} in your cluster, you can uninstall the `ibm-object-storage-plugin` and the `ibmc` Helm plug-in.
{: shortdesc}

Removing the `ibmc` Helm plug-in or the `ibm-object-storage-plugin` doesn't remove existing PVCs, PVs, or data. When you remove the `ibm-object-storage-plugin`, all the related driver pods and daemon sets are removed from your cluster, which means you can't provision new {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} for your cluster unless you configure your app to use the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} API directly. There is no impact on existing PVCs and PVs.
{: important}

Before you begin:

- [Log in to your account. If applicable, target the appropriate resource group. Set the context for your cluster.](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cli_install#cs_cli_configure)
- Make sure that you don't have any PVCs or PVs in your cluster that use {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. To list all pods that mount a specific PVC, run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}{" "}{end}{end}' | grep "<pvc_name>"`.

To remove the `ibmc` Helm plug-in and the `ibm-object-storage-plugin`:

1. Get the name of your `ibm-object-storage-plugin` Helm installation.

    ```sh
    helm ls -A | grep ibm-object-storage-plugin
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh

    ```
    {: screen}

2. Uninstall the `ibm-object-storage-plugin`.

    ```sh
    helm uninstall <release_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example command for a release named `ibm-object-storage-plugin`.

    ```sh
    helm uninstall ibm-object-storage-plugin
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the `ibm-object-storage-plugin` pods are removed.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pod -n <namespace> | grep object-storage
    ```
    {: pre}

    The removal of the pods is successful if no pods are displayed in your CLI output. The removal of the storage classes is successful if no storage classes are displayed in your CLI output.

4. Verify that the storage classes are removed.

    ```sh
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep s3
    ```
    {: pre}

5. If you use OS X or a Linux distribution, remove the `ibmc` Helm plug-in. If you use Windows, this step is not required.

    1. Remove the `ibmc` Helm plug-in.

        ```sh
        helm plugin uninstall ibmc
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Verify that the `ibmc` plug-in is removed. The `ibmc` plug-in is removed successfully if the `ibmc` plug-in is not listed in your CLI output.

        ```sh
        helm plugin list
        ```
        {: pre}

2. Choose a storage class that fits your data access requirements. The storage class determines the [pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/objectstorage/create#pricing){: external} for storage capacity, read and write operations, and outbound bandwidth for a bucket. The option that is correct for you is based on how frequently data is read and written to your service instance.
    - **Standard**: This option is used for hot data that is accessed frequently. Common use cases are web or mobile apps.
    - **Vault**: This option is used for workloads or cool data that are accessed infrequently, such as once a month or less. Common use cases are archives, short-term data retention, digital asset preservation, tape replacement, and disaster recovery.
    - **Cold**: This option is used for cold data that is rarely accessed (every 90 days or less), or inactive data. Common use cases are archives, long-term backups, historical data that you keep for compliance, or workloads and apps that are rarely accessed.
    - **Flex**: This option is used for workloads and data that don't follow a specific usage pattern, or that are too huge to determine or predict a usage pattern. **Tip:** Check out this [blog](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-archive/2017/03/interconnect-2017-changing-rules-storage/){: external} to learn how the Flex storage class works compared to traditional storage tiers.   

3. Decide on the level of resiliency for the data that is stored in your bucket.
    - **Cross-region**: With this option, your data is stored across three regions within a geolocation for highest availability. If you have workloads that are distributed across regions, requests are routed to the nearest regional endpoint. The API endpoint for the geolocation is automatically set by the `ibmc` Helm plug-in that you installed earlier based on the location that your cluster is in. For example, if your cluster is in `US South`, then your storage classes are configured to use the `US GEO` API endpoint for your buckets. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints).  
    - **Regional**: With this option, your data is replicated across multiple zones within one region. If you have workloads that are located in the same region, you see lower latency and better performance than in a cross-regional setup. The regional endpoint is automatically set by the `ibm` Helm plug-in that you installed earlier based on the location that your cluster is in. For example, if your cluster is in `US South`, then your storage classes were configured to use `US South` as the regional endpoint for your buckets. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](/docs/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints).

4. Review the detailed {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket configuration for a storage class.

    :   Enable the logging of requests that are sent to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance. If enabled, logs are sent to `syslog` and you can [forward the logs to an external logging server](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health#logging). By default, all storage classes are set to `false` to disable this logging feature.
    
    `ibm.io/debug-level`
    :   The logging level that is set by the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in. All storage classes are set up with the `WARN` logging level.
    
    `ibm.io/iam-endpoint`
    :   The API endpoint for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). 
    
    `ibm.io/kernel-cache`
    :   Enable or disable the kernel buffer cache for the volume mount point. If enabled, data that is read from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} is stored in the kernel cache to ensure fast read access to your data. If disabled, data is not cached and always read from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. Kernel cache is enabled for `standard` and `flex` storage classes, and disabled for `cold` and `vault` storage classes. 
    
    `ibm.io/multireq-max`
    :   The maximum number of parallel requests that can be sent to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance to list files in a single directory. All storage classes are set up with a maximum of 20 parallel requests.
    
    `ibm.io/object-store-endpoint`
    :   The API endpoint to use to access the bucket in your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance. The endpoint is automatically set based on the region of your cluster. If you want to access an existing bucket that is located in a different region than the one where your cluster is in, you must [create a custom storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#customized_storageclass) and use the API endpoint for your bucket.
    
    `ibm.io/object-store-storage-class`
    :   The name of the storage class.
    
    `ibm.io/parallel-count`
    :   The maximum number of parallel requests that can be sent to the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance for a single read or write operation. Storage classes with `perf` in their name are set up with a maximum of 20 parallel requests. Storage classes without `perf` are set up with two parallel requests by default.
    
    `ibm.io/s3fs-fuse-retry-count`
    :   The maximum number of retries for a read or write operation before the operation is considered unsuccessful. All storage classes are set up with a maximum of five retries.
    
    `ibm.io/stat-cache-size`
    :   The maximum number of records that are kept in the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} metadata cache. Every record can take up to 0.5 kilobytes. All storage classes set the maximum number of records to 100000 by default.
    
    `ibm.io/tls-cipher-suite`
    :   The TLS cipher suite that must be used when a connection to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} is established via the HTTPS endpoint. The value for the cipher suite must follow the [OpenSSL format](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html){: external}. If your worker nodes run an Ubuntu operating system, your storage classes are set up to use the `AESGCM`cipher suite by default. For worker nodes that run a Red Hat operating system, the `ecdhe_rsa_aes_128_gcm_sha_256` cipher suite is used by default.


    For more information about each storage class, see the [storage class reference](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_reference). If you want to change any of the pre-set values, create your own [customized storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kube_concepts#customized_storageclass).
    {: tip}

5. Decide on a name for your bucket. The name of a bucket must be unique in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. You can also choose to automatically create a name for your bucket by the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} plug-in. To organize data in a bucket, you can create subdirectories.

    The storage class that you chose earlier determines the pricing for the entire bucket. You can't define different storage classes for subdirectories. If you want to store data with different access requirements, consider creating multiple buckets by using multiple PVCs.
    {: note}

6. Choose if you want to keep your data and the bucket after the cluster or the persistent volume claim (PVC) is deleted. When you delete the PVC, the PV is always deleted. You can choose if you want to also automatically delete the data and the bucket when you delete the PVC. Your {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance is independent from the retention policy that you select for your data and is never removed when you delete a PVC.

Now that you decided on the configuration that you want, you are ready to [create a PVC](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_apps) to provision {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.


## Verifying your installation
{: #cos-plugin-verify}

Review the pod details to verify that the plug-in installation succeeded.
{: shortdesc}

1. Verify the installation succeeded by listing the driver pods.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pod --all-namespaces -o wide | grep object
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    ibmcloud-object-storage-driver-9n8g8                              1/1       Running   0          2m
    ibmcloud-object-storage-plugin-7c774d484b-pcnnx                   1/1       Running   0          2m
    ```
    {: screen}

    The installation is successful when you see one `ibmcloud-object-storage-plugin` pod and one or more `ibmcloud-object-storage-driver` pods. The number of `ibmcloud-object-storage-driver` pods equals the number of worker nodes in your cluster. All pods must be in a `Running` state for the plug-in to function properly. If the pods fail, run `kubectl describe pod -n ibm-object-s3fs <pod_name>` to find the root cause for the failure.

1. Verify that the storage classes are created successfully.

    ```sh
    kubectl get storageclass | grep s3
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    ibmc-s3fs-cold-cross-region            ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m
    ibmc-s3fs-cold-regional                ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m
    ibmc-s3fs-flex-cross-region            ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m

    ibmc-s3fs-standard-perf-regional       ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m
    ibmc-s3fs-standard-regional            ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m
    ibmc-s3fs-vault-cross-region           ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m
    ibmc-s3fs-vault-regional               ibm.io/ibmc-s3fs   8m
    ```
    {: screen}

    If you want to set one of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} storage classes as your default storage class, run `kubectl patch storageclass <storageclass> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'`. Replace `<storageclass>` with the name of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} storage class.
