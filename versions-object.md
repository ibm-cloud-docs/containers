Because this update affects regional storage classes, you must uninstall and reinstall the `2.2.13` chart so the new storage classes are created in your cluster. This change primarily impacts single site clusters because the regional storage classes, such as `ibmc-s3fs-standard-regional`, now point to the single site COS endpoint instead of the regional endpoints. This change is not applied automatically to existing PVCs and pods. You must create new PVCs with the new storage classes for the changes to take effect. For more information on how to update your PVCs, refer to the [Adding object storage to apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_apps) documentation.

- If you want to overwrite the value from `default` to any other specific `tls-cipher-suite`, annotate your PVC with `ibm.io/tls-cipher-suite: "<cipher-suite-value>"`. 

Because this change affects storage classes, you must uninstall and reinstall the 2.2.6 chart so the new storage classes are created in your cluster. This change is not automatically applied to existing PVCs and pods. You must create new PVCs with the new storage classes for the changes to take effect.
