# Enabling the {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_full_notm}} cluster add-on
{: #storage-file-vpc-install}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc}

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_full_notm}} is persistent, fast, and flexible network-attached, NFS-based {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} that you can add to your apps by using Kubernetes persistent volumes claims (PVCs). You can choose between predefined storage classes that meet the GB sizes and IOPS that meet the requirements of your workloads. To find out if {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} is the correct storage option for you, see [Choosing a storage solution](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-plan). For pricing information, see [Pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/infrastructure/provision/fileShare){: external}.

The {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} cluster add-on is available in Beta. 
{: beta}

The following limitations apply to the add-on beta.

- It is recommended that your cluster and VPC are part of same resource group. If your cluster and VPC are in separate resource groups, then before you can provision file shares, you must create your own storage class and provide your VPC resource group ID. For more information, see [Creating your own storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-file-vpc-apps#storage-file-vpc-custom-sc).
- New security group rules were introduced in cluster versions 1.25 and later. These rule changes mean that you must sync your security groups before you can use {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}. For more information, see [Adding {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} to apps](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-file-vpc-apps).
- New storage classes were added with version 2.0 of the add-on. You can no longer provision new file shares that use the older storage classes. Existing volumes that use the older storage classes continue to function, however you cannot expand the volumes that were created using the older classes. For more information, see the [Migrating to a new storage class](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-file-vpc-apps#storage-file-expansion-migration).



Need to update the add-on to a newer version? See [Updating the {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} add-on](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-file-vpc-managing#storage-file-vpc-update)
{: tip}


1. Update the `container-service` CLI plug-in.
    ```shell
    ibmcloud update && ibmcloud plugin update container-service
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Get a list of the add-on versions and decide which version to install for your cluster version.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon versions --addon vpc-file-csi-driver
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output
    ```sh
    Name                  Version         Supported Kubernetes Range   Supported OpenShift Range   Kubernetes Default   OpenShift Default
    vpc-file-csi-driver   2.0 (default)   >=1.30.0                     >=4.15.0                    -                    -
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Enable the add-on and follow the prompts to install any dependencies. Version 2.0 is recommended.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon enable vpc-file-csi-driver --version 2.0 --cluster CLUSTER
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output
    ```sh
    Enabling add-on vpc-file-csi-driver(2.0) for cluster devcluster2...
    The add-on might take several minutes to deploy and become ready for use.
    The ibm-storage-operator add-on version 1.0 is required to enable the vpc-file-csi-driver add-on. Enable ibm-storage-operator? [y/N]> y
    ```
    {: screen}

    Example prompt to install dependencies.
    ```sh
    The ibm-storage-operator add-on version 1.0 is required to enable the vpc-file-csi-driver add-on. Enable ibm-storage-operator? [y/N]> y
    ```
    {: pre}


1. Verify that the add-on is enabled.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster addon ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output
    ```sh
    Name                   Version   Health State   Health Status
    ibm-storage-operator   1.0       normal         Addon Ready. For more info: http://ibm.biz/addon-state (H1500)
    vpc-file-csi-driver    2.0       normal         Addon Ready. For more info: http://ibm.biz/addon-state (H1500)
    ```
