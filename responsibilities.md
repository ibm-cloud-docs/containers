Compliance to industry standards varies depending on the infrastructure provider that you use for the cluster, such as classic or VPC. You are responsible for the security and compliance of any workloads that run in the cluster and your application data. For more information, see [What standards does the service comply to?](/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs#standards).
{: shortdesc}

| Resource | IBM responsibilities | Your responsibilities |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| General | - Maintain controls commensurate to [various industry compliance standards](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update#update), such as PCI DSS. Compliance to industry standards varies depending on the infrastructure provider of the cluster, such as classic or VPC. \n - Monitor, isolate, and recover the cluster master. \n - Provide highly available replicas of the Kubernetes master API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller manager components to protect against a master outage. \n - Provide options for cluster network connectivity, such as public and private cloud service endpoints. \n - Provide options for compute isolation, such as dedicated virtual machines or bare metal. \n - Integrate Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). | - Set up and maintain security and regulation compliance for your apps and data. For example, choose how to set up your [classic cluster networking](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-classic) or [VPC cluster networking](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cluster-create-vpc-gen2), [protect sensitive information](/docs/containers?topic=containers-encryption) such as with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong_notm}} encryption, and configure further [security settings](/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#security) to meet your workload's security and compliance needs.

### Disaster recovery
{: #disaster-recovery}

IBM is responsible for the recovery of {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} components in case of disaster. You are responsible for the recovery of the workloads that run the cluster and your application data. If you integrate with other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services such as file, block, object, cloud database, logging, or audit event services, consult those services' disaster recovery information.
{: shortdesc}

| Resource | IBM responsibilities | Your responsibilities |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| General | - Maintain service availability across [worldwide locations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones) so that customers can deploy clusters across zones and regions for higher DR tolerance. \n - Provision clusters with three replicas of master components for high availability. \n - In multizone regions, automatically spread the master replicas across zones. \n - Continuously monitor to work to ensure the reliability and availability of the service environment by site reliability engineers. \n - Update and recover operational {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} and Kubernetes components within the cluster, such as the Ingress application load balancer and file storage plug-in. \n - Back up and recover data in etcd, such as your Kubernetes workload configuration files \n - Provide the optional [worker node Autorecovery](/docs/containers?topic=containers-health-monitor#autorecovery). \n - Provide the ability to integrate with other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services such as storage providers so that data can be backed up and restored. | - Set up and maintain disaster recovery capabilities for your apps and data. For example, to prepare your cluster for HA/DR scenarios, follow the guidance in [High availability for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers?topic=containers-strategy).

### Applications and data
{: #applications-and-data}

You are completely responsible for the applications, workloads, and data that you deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. However, IBM provides various tools to help you set up, manage, secure, integrate and optimize your apps as described in the following table.
{: shortdesc}

| Resource | How IBM helps | What you can do |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Applications  |- Provision clusters with Kubernetes components installed so that you can access the Kubernetes API to deploy and manage your containerized apps. \n - Provide a number of managed add-ons to extend your app's capabilities, such as [Istio](/docs/containers?topic=containers-istio) or the Diagnostics and Debug Tool. Maintenance is simplified for you because IBM provides the installation and updates for the managed add-ons. \n - Provide cluster integration with select third-party partnership technologies, such as {{site.data.keyword.la_short}}, {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}}, and Portworx. \n - Provide automation to enable service binding to other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services. \n - Create clusters with image pull secrets so that your deployments in the `default` Kubernetes namespace can pull images from {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}. \n - Provide access to Kubernetes APIs that you can use to set up Operators to add community, third-party, and your own services to your cluster. Note that Operators might not work without manual adjustments such as changes in cluster security policies. \n - Provide storage classes and plug-ins to support persistent volumes for use with your apps. \n - Automatically configure security settings to prevent insecure access, such as disabling SSH into the worker node compute hosts. \n - Automatically integrate {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM service access roles with Kubernetes RBAC roles in the cluster. \n - Generate an API key that is used to access infrastructure permissions for each resource group and region. | - Maintain responsibility for your apps, data, and their complete lifecycle. \n - If you add community, third-party, your own, or other services to your cluster such as by using Operators, you are responsible for these services and for working with the appropriate provider to troubleshoot any issues. \n - Use the provided tools and features to [configure and deploy](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app); [keep up-to-date](/docs/containers?topic=containers-update_app#app_rolling); [set up resource requests and limits](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#resourcereq); [size your worker pool](/docs/containers?topic=containers-strategy) to have enough resources to run your apps; [set up permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-iam-platform-access-roles); [integrate with other services](/docs/containers?topic=containers-supported_integrations#supported_integrations); [externally serve](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#cs_network_planning); [save, back up, and restore data](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage-plan); and otherwise manage your [highly available](/docs/containers?topic=containers-strategy) and resilient workloads.  \n - Some managed add-on operators allow you to control how updates are applied. If you choose to manually apply the updates, you receive notifications when an update is available, then you must promptly complete the manual update. If you choose to have updates applied automatically, you receive notifications, but the updates are automatically applied. There is no roll-back capability, so make sure to choose your update strategy carefully. |
| Data | - Maintain [platform-level standards](/docs/overview?topic=overview-security) so that your data can be stored with controls commensurate to leading international security compliance standards. \n - Provision clusters with Kubernetes components installed so that you can access the Kubernetes API to help manage your app data, such as with secrets and configmaps. \n - Integrate with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that you can use to store and manage your data, such as {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Databases or {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. \n - Integrate with {{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson_notm}} services that you can use to maximize the insights and use of your data with the latest artificial intelligence technology.| - Maintain responsibility for your data and how your apps consume the data. |
