# Saving data in your cluster
{: #storage}
You can persist data in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to share data between app instances and to protect your data from being lost if a component in your Kubernetes cluster fails.

## Planning highly available storage
{: #planning}

In {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, you can choose from several options to store your app data and share data across pods in your cluster. However, not all storage options offer the same level of persistence and availability in situations where a component in your cluster or a whole site fails.
{: shortdesc}

### Non-persistent data storage options
{: #non_persistent}

You can use non-persistent storage options if your data is not required to be persistently stored or if data does not need to be shared across app instances. Non-persistent storage options can also be used to unit-test your app components or try out new features.
{: shortdesc}

The following image shows available non-persistent data storage options in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. These options are available for free and standard clusters.

### Persistent data storage options for high availability
{: #persistent}

The main challenge when you create highly available stateful apps is to persist data across multiple app instances in multiple locations, and to keep data in sync always. For highly available data, you want to make sure that you have a master database with multiple instances that are spread across multiple data centers or even multiple regions. This master database must continuously be replicated to keep a single source of truth. All instances in your cluster must read from and write to this master database. In case one instance of the master is down, other instances take over the workload so that you do not experience downtime for your apps.
{: shortdesc}

The following image shows the options that you have in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} to make your data highly available in a standard cluster. The option that is right for you depends on the following factors:
  * **The type of app that you have:** For example, you might have an app that must store data on a file basis rather than inside a database.
  * **Legal requirements for where to store and route the data:** For example, you might be obligated to store and route data in the United States only and you cannot use a service that is located in Europe.
  * **Backup and restore options:** Every storage option comes with capabilities to back up and restore data. Check that available backup and restore options meet the requirements of your disaster recovery plan, such as the frequency of backups or the capabilities of storing data outside your primary data center.
  * **Global replication:** For high availability, you might want to set up multiple storage instances that are distributed and replicated across data centers worldwide.

## Using existing NFS file shares in clusters
{: #existing}

If you have existing NFS file shares in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account that you want to use, you can do so by creating a persistent volume (PV) for your existing storage.
{:shortdesc}

A persistent volume (PV) is a Kubernetes resource that represents an actual storage device that is provisioned in a data center. Persistent volumes abstract the details of how a specific storage type is provisioned by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Storage. To mount a PV to your cluster, you must request persistent storage for your pod by creating a persistent volume claim (PVC). The following diagram illustrates the relationship between PVs and PVCs.

![Create persistent volumes and persistent volume claims](images/cs_cluster_pv_pvc.png)

As depicted in the diagram, to enable existing NFS storage, you must create PVs with a certain size and access mode and create a PVC that matches the PV specification. If the PV and PVC match, they are bound to each other. Only bound PVCs can be used by the cluster user to mount the volume to a deployment. This process is referred to as static provisioning of persistent storage.

Before you begin, make sure that you have an existing NFS file share that you can use to create your PV. For example, if you previously [created a PVC with a `retain` storage class policy](#create), you can use that retained data in the existing NFS file share for this new PVC.

**Note:** Static provisioning of persistent storage applies to existing NFS file shares only. If you do not have existing NFS file shares, cluster users can use the [dynamic provisioning](cs_storage.html#create) process to add PVs.

To create a PV and matching PVC, follow these steps.

1.  In your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account, look up the ID and path of the NFS file share where you want to create your PV object. In addition, authorize the file storage to the subnets in the cluster. This authorization gives your cluster access to the storage.
    1.  Log in to your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.
    2.  Click **Storage**.
    3.  Click **File Storage** and from the **Actions** menu, select **Authorize Host**.
    4.  Select **Subnets**.
    5.  From the drop-down list, select the private VLAN subnet that your worker node is connected to. To find the subnet of your worker node, run `bx cs workers <cluster_name>` and compare the `Private IP` of your worker node with the subnet that you found in the drop-down list.
    6.  Click **Submit**.
    6.  Click the name of the file storage.
    7.  Note the **Mount Point** field. The field is displayed as `<server>:/<path>`.
2.  Create a storage configuration file for your PV. Include the server and path from the file storage **Mount Point** field.

    ```

4.  Verify that the PV is created.

    ```
    kubectl get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  Create another configuration file to create your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV object that you created earlier, you must choose the same value for `storage` and `accessMode`. The `storage-class` field must be empty. If any of these fields do not match the PV, then a new PV is created automatically instead.

## Using existing block storage in your cluster
{: #existing_block}

Before you begin, make sure that you have an existing block storage instance that you can use to create your PV. For example, if you previously [created a PVC with a `retain` storage class policy](#create), you can use that retained data in the existing block storage for this new PVC.

**Note**: Block storage is a `ReadWriteOnce` access mode device. You can mount it to only one pod on one worker node in the cluster at a time.

To create a PV and matching PVC, follow these steps.

1.  Retrieve or generate an API key for your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.
    1. Log in to the [IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) portal ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/).
    2. Select **Account**, then **Users**, and then **User List**.
    3. Find your user ID.
    4. In the **API KEY** column, click **Generate** to generate an API key or **View** to view your existing API key.
2.  Retrieve the API user name for your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.
    1. From the **User List** menu, select your user ID.
    2. In the **API Access Information** section, find your **API Username**.
3.  Log in to the IBM Cloud infrastructure CLI plug-in.
    ```
    bx sl init
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  Choose to authenticate by using the user name and API key for your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.
5.  Enter the user name and API key that you retrieved in the previous steps.
6.  List available block storage devices.

## Adding NFS file storage or block storage to apps
{: #create}

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to provision NFS file storage or block storage for your cluster. Then, mount this claim to a persistent volume (PV) to ensure that data is available even if the pods crash or shut down.
{:shortdesc}

The NFS file storage and block storage that backs the PV is clustered by IBM in order to provide high availability for your data. The storage classes describe the types of storage offerings available and define aspects such as the data retention policy, size in gigabytes, and IOPS when you create your PV.

**Note**: Block storage is a `ReadWriteOnce` access mode device. You can mount it to only one pod on one worker node in the cluster at a time. NFS file storage is a `ReadWriteMany` access mode, so you can mount it to multiple pods across workers within the cluster.

Before you begin:
- If you have a firewall, [allow egress access](cs_firewall.html#pvc) for the IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) IP ranges of the locations that your clusters are in so that you can create PVCs.
- If you want to mount block storage to your apps, you must install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Storage plug-in for block storage](#install_block) first.

To add persistent storage:

1.  Review the available storage classes. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} provides pre-defined storage classes for NFS file storage and block storage so that the cluster admin does not have to create any storage classes. The `ibmc-file-bronze` storage class is the same as the `default` storage class. By default, file storage is provisioned with an `nfs` file system, and block storage is provisioned with an `ext4` file system. If you want to provision block storage with an `XFS` file system, [create your own custom storage class](#custom_storageclass). 

    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    $ kubectl get storageclasses
    NAME                         TYPE
    default                      ibm.io/ibmc-file

    **Tip:** If you want to change the default storage class, run `kubectl patch storageclass <storageclass> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'` and replace `<storageclass>` with the name of the storage class.

2.  Decide if you want to keep your data and the NFS file share or block storage after you delete the PVC.
    - If you want to keep your data, then choose a `retain` storage class. When you delete the PVC, the PV is removed, but the NFS file or block storage and your data still exist in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account. Later, to access this data in your cluster, create a PVC and a matching PV that refers to your existing [NFS file](#existing) or [block](#existing_block) storage.
    - If you want the data and your NFS file share or block storage to be deleted when you delete the PVC, choose a storage class without `retain`.

3.  **If you choose a bronze, silver, or gold storage class**: You get [Endurance storage ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/endurance-storage) that defines the IOPS per GB for each class. However, you can determine the total IOPS by choosing a size within the available range. You can select any whole number of gigabyte sizes within the allowed size range (such as 20 Gi, 256 Gi, 11854 Gi). For example, if you select a 1000Gi file share or block storage size in the silver storage class of 4 IOPS per GB, your volume has a total of 4000 IOPS. The more IOPS your PV has, the faster it processes input and output operations. The following table describes the IOPS per gigabyte and size range for each storage class.

    <table>
         <caption>Table of storage class size ranges and IOPS per gigabyte</caption>
         <thead>
         <th>Storage class</th>
         <th>IOPS per gigabyte</th>
         <th>Size range in gigabytes</th>

4.  **If you choose the custom storage class**: You get [Performance storage ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/performance-storage) and have more control over choosing the combination of IOPS and size. For example, if you select a size of 40Gi for your PVC, you can choose IOPS that is a multiple of 100 that is in the range of 100 - 2000 IOPS. The following table shows you what range of IOPS you can choose depending on the size that you select.

5.  Decide if you want to be billed on an hourly or monthly basis. By default, you are billed monthly.

6.  Create a configuration file to define your PVC and save the configuration as a `.yaml` file.

    -  **Example for bronze, silver, gold storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the `"ibmc-file-silver"` storage class, billed `"hourly"`, with a gigabyte size of `24Gi`. If you want to create a PVC to mount block storage to your cluster, make sure to enter `ReadWriteOnce` in the `accessModes` section.

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         annotations:
           volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-silver"
         labels:
           billingType: "hourly"
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteMany

           requests:
             storage: 24Gi
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    -  **Example for custom storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the storage class `ibmc-file-retain-custom`, billed at the default of `"monthly"`, with a gigabyte size of `45Gi` and IOPS of `"300"`. If you want to create a PVC to mount block storage to your cluster, make sure to enter `ReadWriteOnce` in the `accessModes` section.

       ```

## Customizing a storage class for XFS block storage
{: #custom_storageclass}

The storage classes that are pre-defined by {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} provision block storage with an `ext4` file system by default. You can create a customized storage class to provision block storage with an `XFS` file system. 
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin: 
- [Target the Kubernetes CLI to the cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).
- Install the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Storage plug-in for block storage](#install_block).

To create a customized storage class: 
1. Create a yaml file for your customized storage class. 
   ```
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: ibmc-block-custom-xfs
     labels:
       addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile
   provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-block
   parameters:
     type: "Performance"
     sizeIOPSRange: |-
       [20-39]Gi:[100-1000]
       [40-79]Gi:[100-2000]
       [80-99]Gi:[100-4000]
       [100-499]Gi:[100-6000]
       [500-999]Gi:[100-10000]
       [1000-1999]Gi:[100-20000]

       [10000-12000]Gi:[1000-48000]
     fsType: "xfs"
     reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
     classVersion: "2"
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
   If you want to keep the data after you remove block storage from your cluster, change the `reclaimPolicy` to `Retain`. 
   {: tip}
   
2. Create the storage class in your cluster. 
   ```
   kubectl apply -f <filepath/xfs_storageclass.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}
       
3. Verify that the customized storage class was created. 
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Provision [XFS block storage](#create) with your customized storage class. 

<br />


## Changing the default NFS file storage version
{: #nfs_version}

The version of the NFS file storage determines the protocol that is used to communicate with the NFS file storage server. By default, all file storage instances are set up with NFS version 4. You can change your existing PV to an older NFS version if your app requires a specific version to properly function. 
{: shortdesc}

To change the default NFS version, you can either create a new storage class to dynamically provision file storage in your cluster, or choose to change an existing PV that is mounted to your pod. 

To apply the latest security updates and for a better performance, use the default NFS version and do not change to an older NFS version. 
{: tip}

**To create a customized storage class with the desired NFS version:**
1. Create a yaml file for your customized storage class. Replace <nfs_version> with the NFS version that you want to use. For example, to provision NFS version 3.0, enter **3.0**.
   ```
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: ibmc-file-mount
     #annotations:
     #  storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
     labels:
       kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
   provisioner: ibm.io/ibmc-file
   parameters:
     type: "Endurance"
     iopsPerGB: "2"
     sizeRange: "[1-12000]Gi"
     reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
     classVersion: "2"
     mountOptions: nfsvers=<nfs_version>
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
   If you want to keep the data after you remove block storage from your cluster, change the `reclaimPolicy` to `Retain`. 
   {: tip}
   
2. Create the storage class in your cluster. 
   ```
   kubectl apply -f <filepath/nfsversion_storageclass.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}
       
3. Verify that the customized storage class was created. 
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Provision [file storage](#create) with your customized storage class. 

**To change your existing PV to use a different NFS version:**

1. Get the PV of the file storage where you want to change the NFS version and note the name of the PV.
   ```
   kubectl get pv
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Add an annotion to your PV. Replace `<version_number>` with the NFS version that you want to use. For example to change to NFS version 3.0, enter **3**.  
   ```
   kubectl patch pv <pv_name> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options":"vers=<version_number>"}}}'
   ```
   {: pre}
   
3. Delete the pod that uses the file storage and re-create the pod. 
   1. Save the pod yaml to your local machine. 
      ```
      kubect get pod <pod_name> -o yaml > <filepath/pod.yaml>
      ```
      {: pre}
      
   2. Delete the pod. 
      ```
      kubectl deleted pod <pod_name>
      ```
      {: pre}
   
   3. Re-create the pod. 
      ```
      kubectl apply -f <filepath/pod.yaml>
      ```
      {: pre}

4. Wait for the pod to deploy. 
   ```
   kubectl get pods

### Updating the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in
You can upgrade the existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in to the latest version.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster.

1. Find the name of the block storage helm chart that you installed in your cluster.
   ```
   helm ls | grep ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   myhelmchart 	1       	Mon Sep 18 15:31:40 2017	DEPLOYED	ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-0.1.0	default
   ```
   {: screen}

2. Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in to the latest version.
   ```
   helm upgrade --force --recreate-pods <helm_chart_name>  ibm/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

<br />


### Removing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in
If you do not want to provision and use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage for your cluster, you can uninstall the helm chart.
{: shortdesc}

**Note:** Removing the plug-in does not remove existing PVCs, PVs, or data. When you remove the plug-in, all the related pods and daemon sets are removed from your cluster. You cannot provision new block storage for your cluster or use existing block storage PVCs and PVs after you remove the plug-in.

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster and make sure that you do not have any PVCs or PVs in your cluster that use block storage.

1. Find the name of the block storage helm chart that you installed in your cluster.
   ```
   helm ls | grep ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}

   Example output:
   ```
   myhelmchart 	1       	Mon Sep 18 15:31:40 2017	DEPLOYED	ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin-0.1.0	default
   ```
   {: screen}

2. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Block Storage plug-in.
   ```
   helm delete <helm_chart_name>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Verify that the block storage pods are removed.
   ```
   kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin
   ```
   {: pre}
   The removal of the pods is successful if no pods are displayed in your CLI output.

4. Verify that the block storage storage classes are removed.
   ```
   kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
   ```
   {: pre}
   The removal of the storage classes is successful if no storage classes are displayed in your CLI output.

## Setting up backup and restore solutions for NFS file shares and block storage
{: #backup_restore}

File shares and block storage are provisioned into the same location as your cluster. The storage is hosted on clustered servers by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to provide availability in case a server goes down. However, file shares and block storage are not backed up automatically and might be inaccessible if the entire location fails. To protect your data from being lost or damaged, you can set up periodic backups that you can use to restore your data when needed.
{: shortdesc}

Review the following backup and restore options for your NFS file shares and block storage:

<dl>
  <dt>Set up periodic snapshots</dt>
  <dd><p>You can set up [periodic snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/snapshots.html) for your NFS file share or block storage, which is a read-only image that captures the state of the instance at a point in time. Snapshots are stored on the same file share or block storage within the same location. You can restore data from a snapshot if a user accidentally removes important data from the volume.</p>
  <p>For more information, see:<ul><li>[NFS periodic snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/snapshots.html)</li><li>[Block periodic snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage/snapshots.html#snapshots)</li></ul></p></dd>
  <dt>Replicate snapshots to another location</dt>
 <dd><p>To protect your data from a location failure, you can [replicate snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/replication.html#working-with-replication) to an NFS file share or block storage instance that is set up in another location. Data can be replicated from the primary storage to the backup storage only. You cannot mount a replicated NFS file share or block storage instance to a cluster. When your primary storage fails, you can manually set your replicated backup storage to be the primary one. Then, you can mount it to your cluster. After your primary storage is restored, you can restore the data from the backup storage.</p>
 <p>For more information, see:<ul><li>[Replicate snapshots for NFS](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/replication.html#working-with-replication)</li><li>[Replicate snapshots for Block](/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage/replication.html#working-with-replication)</li></ul></p></dd>
 <dt>Duplicate storage</dt>
 <dd><p>You can duplicate your NFS file share or block storage instance in the same location as the original storage instance. A duplicate has the same data as the original storage instance at the point in time that you create the duplicate. Unlike replicas, use the duplicate as an independent storage instance from the original. To duplicate, first set up snapshots for the volume.</p>
 <p>For more information, see:<ul><li>[NFS duplicate snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/how-to-create-duplicate-volume.html#creating-a-duplicate-file-storage)</li><li>[Block duplicate snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage/how-to-create-duplicate-volume.html#creating-a-duplicate-block-volume)</li></ul></p></dd>
  <dt>Back up data to Object Storage</dt>
  <dd><p>You can use the [**ibm-backup-restore image**](/docs/services/RegistryImages/ibm-backup-restore/index.html#ibmbackup_restore_starter) to spin up a backup and restore pod in your cluster. This pod contains a script to run a one-time or periodic backup for any persistent volume claim (PVC) in your cluster. Data is stored in your {{site.data.keyword.objectstoragefull}} instance that you set up in a location.</p>
  <p>To make your data even more highly available and protect your app from a location failure, set up a second {{site.data.keyword.objectstoragefull}} instance and replicate data across locations. If you need to restore data from your {{site.data.keyword.objectstoragefull}} instance, use the restore script that is provided with the image.</p></dd>
<dt>Copy data to and from pods and containers</dt>
<dd><p>You can use the `kubectl cp` [command![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/#cp) to copy files and directories to and from pods or specific containers in your cluster.</p>
<p>Before you begin, [target your Kubernetes CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster that you want to use. If you do not specify a container with <code>-c</code>, the command uses to the first available container in the pod.</p>
<p>You can use the command in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy data from your local machine to a pod in your cluster: <code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;local_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var> <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var></code></li>
<li>Copy data from a pod in your cluster to your local machine: <code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var> <var>&lt;local_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var></code></li>
<li>Copy data from a pod in your cluster to a specific container in another pod another: <code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var> <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;other_pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var> -c <var>&lt;container></var></code></li>
</ul>
</dd>
  </dl>
