# IAM roles and actions
{: #iam-platform-access-roles}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is configured to use {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} roles to determine the actions that users can perform on {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters, worker nodes, and Ingress application load balancers (ALBs).
{: shortdesc}

Review the following table for a list of Platform and Service roles and their associated actions.

{{../account/iam-service-roles.md#containers-kubernetes-roles}}

For a list of all IBM services and their associated roles and actions, see [IAM roles and actions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions). For more information about setting up your account and resources, see [best practices for organizing users, teams, and applications](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup).
{: tip}


Platform access roles
:   With platform access roles, users can manage resources like clusters, worker pools, worker nodes, and add-ons. Example actions that are permitted by platform access roles are creating or removing clusters, binding services to a cluster, managing networking and storage resources, or adding extra worker nodes. You can set the policies for these roles by resource group, region, or cluster instance. You can't scope a platform access role by namespace within a cluster. Platform access roles don't grant access to the Kubernetes API to manage resources within the cluster, like Kubernetes pods, namespaces, or services.

Service access roles
:   Use service access roles to grant users access to manage Kubernetes resources within {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters. Service access roles are synchronized with corresponding [Kubernetes RBAC policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-understand-rbac) in a cluster. As such, service access roles grant access to the Kubernetes API, dashboard, and CLI (`kubectl`). Example actions that are permitted by service access roles include creating app deployments, adding namespaces, or setting up configmaps. You can scope the policy for service access roles by resource group, region, or cluster instance. Further, you can also scope service access roles to Kubernetes namespaces that are in all clusters, individual clusters, or clusters in a specific region. 

## Permissions to create a cluster
{: #cluster-create-permissions}

Review the following permissions that you need to create a cluster including the required permissions for other integrations and services that you might use.


| Service or resource group | Role | Scope | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {{site.data.keyword.containershort}} | - **Administrator** platform access role  \n - **Writer** or **Manager** service access role | The resource group where you want to create a cluster. | Yes |
| {{site.data.keyword.registryshort_notm}} | **Administrator** platform access role. | An individual instance or all instances. Do not limit policies for {{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}} to the resource group level. | Yes |
| {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} | - **Administrator** or **Editor** platform access role  \n - **Manager** service access role | All resource groups | Required if you plan to use {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} for encryption. |
| Resource group permissions | - **Viewer** platform access role  | The resource group where you want to create a cluster. | Yes |
| IAM Identity Service | - **Service ID creator**  \n - **User API key creator** role  \n - **Viewer** platform access role  | The resource group where you want to create a cluster. | Yes |
| {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}| **Administrator** platform access role. | All instances or the specific instance you want to use. | Required if you plan to use {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} for encryption. |
| {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} | **Administrator** platform access role. | All instances or the specific instance you want to use. | Required if you plan to use {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} for encryption. | 
| Classic infrastructure | **Super User** role. For more information, see [Classic infrastructure roles](#iam-platform-access-roles). | N/A | Yes | 
| VPC infrastructure | **Administrator** platform access role for [VPC Infrastructure](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started). | All instances or the specific instance you want to use. | Yes |

Consider saving the permissions outlined in the earlier table as a custom IAM role. This way, you can assign users to the custom role instead of assigning each individual service. For more information, see the following example custom roles or the IAM documentation for [Creating custom roles](/docs/account?topic=account-custom-roles&interface=ui).
{: tip}



## Example custom IAM roles
{: #example-iam}

The following table provides some example use cases and the corresponding IAM roles for those cases. You can use these examples or create your own custom roles. For more information, see [Creating custom roles](/docs/account?topic=account-custom-roles&interface=ui).


| Example custom role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| App auditor | - **Viewer** platform access role for a cluster, region, or resource group.  \n - **Reader** service access role for a cluster, region, or resource group. |
| App developers | - Editor platform access role for a cluster. \n - Writer service access role scoped to a namespace. |
| Billing | **Viewer** platform access role for a cluster, region, or resource group. |
| Cluster administrator | - **Administrator** platform access role for a cluster.  \n - **Manager** service access role for the whole cluster (not scoped to a namespace).|
| DevOps operator | - **Operator** platform access role for a cluster.  \n - **Writer** service access role for the whole cluster (not scoped to a namespace).  |
| Operator or site reliability engineer | - **Administrator** platform access role for a cluster, region, or resource group. \n - Reader service access role for a cluster or region.  \n - **Manager** service access role for all cluster namespaces to be able to use `kubectl top nodes,pods` commands. |

## Classic infrastructure roles
{: #classic-roles}

A user with the **Super User** infrastructure access role sets the API key for a region and resource group so that infrastructure actions can be performed.

The infrastructure actions that other users in the account can perform are authorized through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM platform access roles. 

Use the following table to customize classic infrastructure permissions only when you can't assign **Super User** to the user who sets the API key. For instructions to assign permissions, see [Customizing infrastructure permissions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-iam-platform-access-roles).

### Required classic infrastructure permissions
{: #required-classic-rbac}

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| IPMI Remote Management | Manage worker nodes.|
| Add Server | Add worker nodes.   \n   \n  **Note**: For worker nodes that have public IP addresses, you also need the **Add Compute with Public Network Port** permission in the **Network** category. |
| Cancel Server | Delete worker nodes. |

| View Virtual Server Details | Required if the cluster has VM worker nodes. List and get details of VM worker nodes. |
| View Hardware Details | Required if the cluster has bare metal worker nodes. List and get details of bare metal worker nodes. |
| Add Support Case | As part of the cluster creation automation, support cases are opened to provision the cluster infrastructure. |
| Edit Support Case | As part of the cluster creation automation, support cases are updated to provision the cluster infrastructure. |
| View Support Case | As part of the cluster creation automation, support cases are used to provision the cluster infrastructure. |

### Suggested classic infrastructure permissions
{: #classic-rbac-suggested}

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Auto virtual server access | Access all worker nodes. |
